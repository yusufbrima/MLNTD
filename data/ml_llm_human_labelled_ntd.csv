2025.0,prognosis,National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan; University of Tabuk,"It is quite challenging to discover the imminent infection producing areas to determine the spreading pattern of the epidemic and adopt a counter strategy to combat the outbreak in a timely manner. Therefore, this paper explores the executive perspective to examine the infrastructure systems, such as street networks, to support the continuity of administrative operations essential to controlling the spread of an epidemic. We achieve this by application of optimization-oriented and unsupervised machine learning methods that assemble analysis and decision-making practices into a data-driven model. First, the proposed model analyzes the infection triggering areas at the street-segment level to implement the smart lockdown (street intervention mechanism). The model then suggests to deliberately closing the streets in such a way that only a minimal number of additional streets should be selected to ensure the safety margins against the epidemic. We achieve this by identifying the critical pathways between the affected streets through shortest path analysis. This enables an instinctive assessment of the path of movement between the immediate vicinity of the affected streets. The proposed model thus increases the ability of the managing authorities to implement the resilience plans in a shorter time, so that the unplanned infrastructure can withstand the catastrophic event that it could suffer. We use the efficiency measure to substantiate the proposed model. The evaluations show that the suggestions produced by the proposed model are far more robust and efficient.",DENGUE-FEVER TRANSMISSION; SPREAD; DISEASE,,A novel smart street intervention mechanism using clustering-based path optimization for street networks,YES
2025.0,prognosis,University of Bergen; University of Bergen; University of Bergen; University of Bergen,"Accumulation modelling uses machine learning to discover the dynamics by which systems acquire discrete features over time. Many systems of biomedical interest show such dynamics: from bacteria acquiring resistances to sets of drugs, to patients acquiring symptoms during the course of progressive disease. Existing approaches for accumulation modelling are typically limited either in the number of features they consider or their ability to characterise interactions between these features - a limitation for the large-scale genetic and/or phenotypic datasets often found in modern biomedical applications. Here, we demonstrate how clustering can make such large-scale datasets tractable for powerful accumulation modelling approaches. Clustering resolves issues of sparsity and high dimensionality in datasets, but complicates the intepretation of the inferred dynamics, especially if observations are not independent. Focussing on hypercubic hidden Markov models (HyperHMM), we introduce several approaches for interpreting, estimating, and bounding the results of the dynamics in these cases and discuss how biomedical insight could be gained from such analyses. We demonstrate this 'Cluster-based HyperHMM' (CHyperHMM) pipeline for synthetic data, clinical data on disease progression in severe malaria, and genomic data for anti-microbial resistance evolution in Klebsiella pneumoniae, reflecting two global health threats.",INFERENCE; NUMBER,"Trond Mohn Foundation Project HyperEvol through the Centre for Antimicrobial Resistance in Western Norway (CAMRIA) [TMS2021TMT09, TMS2020TMT11]; European Research Council (ERC) under European Union [805046]",Clustering Large-Scale Biomedical Data to Model Dynamic Accumulation Processes in Disease Progression and Anti-Microbial Resistance Evolution,YES

While microscopy is still the gold standard in malaria diagnosis, it relies heavily on trained personnel. Artificial intelligence (AI) advances, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have significantly improved diagnostic capabilities and accuracy by enabling the automated analysis of medical images. Previous models efficiently detected malaria parasites in red blood cells but had difficulty differentiating between species. We propose a CNN-based model for classifying cells infected by P. falciparum, P. vivax, and uninfected white blood cells from thick blood smears. Our best-performing model utilizes a seven-channel input and correctly predicted 12,876 out of 12,954 cases. We also generated a cross-validation confusion matrix that showed the results of five iterations, achieving 63,654 out of 64,126 true predictions.

By including stochasticity into the model via the suggested stochastic differential equations, we are confiscating the random fluctuations required for disease growth and spread. The stability, convergence, and accurate characteristics of the LSCM are meticulously examined, showcasing its efficacy in addressing complicated epidemiological problems. Furthermore, this mathematical model is used to explain the transmission dynamics of scabies infection in the population with standard incident rate. The dynamics of scabies are illustrated schematically, and then an ordinary differential equation (ODE) is derived using the law of mass action. Positiveness, boundedness, and equilibrium points have been analyzed. Next-generation techniques are used to determine the reproduction number. Sensitivity analysis is also accomplished to investigate the impact of various parameters of reproduction number. Disease-free equilibrium exists asymptotically in local whenever R-0<1. The accuracy and effectiveness of the constructed stochastic computing using neural networks are shown by a comparison of the results derived from the dataset utilizing the spectral collocation approach.

A major challenge is the inaccessibility of current vector mosquito abundance data due to a 2-week reporting delay, which limits timely implementation of control measures. We aimed to nowcast mosquito abundance and assess its utility by evaluating the predictive value of mosquito abundance for malaria epidemic peaks. We used machine learning models to nowcast mosquito abundance, employing gradient boosting models (GBMs), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and an ensemble model combining both. Various meteorological factors served as predictors. The models were trained with data from mosquito collection sites between 2009 and 2021 and tested with data from 2022. To evaluate the utility of nowcasting, we calculated the effective reproduction number (Rt), which can indicate malaria epidemic peaks. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were then used to assess the impact of vector mosquito abundance on Rt. The ensemble models demonstrated the best performance in nowcasting mosquito abundance, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.90 and R-squared value (R-2) value of 0.85. The GBM model showed an RMSE of 0.91 and R-2 of 0.84, while the XGB model had an RMSE of 0.92 and R-2 of 0.85. Additionally, the R-2 of the GLMs predicting Rt using mosquito abundance 2 weeks in advance was >0.72 for all provinces. The mosquito abundance coefficients were also significant. We constructed reliable models to nowcast mosquito abundance. These outcomes could potentially be incorporated into a malaria early warning system.

Chat generative pretrained transformer (ChatGPT) has the potential to assist in medical tasks, yet its diagnostic performance in clinical settings has rarely been evaluated. We conducted a validation assessment of ChatGPT-4o's performance in the workup of fever in returning travellers.Methods We retrieved the medical records of returning travellers hospitalized with fever during 2009-2024. Their clinical scenarios at time of presentation to the emergency department were prompted to ChatGPT-4o, using a detailed uniform format. The model was further prompted with four consistent questions concerning the differential diagnosis and recommended workup. To avoid training, we kept the model blinded to the final diagnosis. Our primary outcome was ChatGPT-4o's success rates in predicting the final diagnosis when requested to specify the top three differential diagnoses. Secondary outcomes were success rates when prompted to specify the single most likely diagnosis, and all necessary diagnostics. We also assessed ChatGPT-4o as a predicting tool for malaria and qualitatively evaluated its failures.Results ChatGPT-4o predicted the final diagnosis in 68% [95% confidence interval (CI) 59-77%], 78% (95% CI 69-85%) and 83% (95% CI 74-89%) of the 114 cases, when prompted to specify the most likely diagnosis, top three diagnoses and all possible diagnoses, respectively.

Traditionally, this approach entails several clinical studies and trials that might last several years, during which strict preventive measures are enforced to manage the outbreak and limit the death toll. Advanced data analytics technologies, on the other hand, could be utilized to monitor and expedite the procedure. This research integrates evolutionary search algorithms, Bayesian belief networks, and innovative interpretation techniques to provide a comprehensive exploratory-descriptive-explanatory machine learning methodology to assist clinical decision-makers in responding promptly to pandemic scenarios. The proposed approach is illustrated through a case study in which the survival of COVID-19 patients is determined using inpatient and emergency department (ED) encounters from a real-world electronic health record database. Following an exploratory phase in which genetic algorithms are used to identify a set of the most critical chronic risk factors and their validation using descriptive tools based on the concept of Bayesian Belief Nets, the framework develops and trains a probabilistic graphical model to explain and predict patient survival (with an AUC of 0.92).

2024.0,treatment monitoring,Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Proteases are key enzymes in viral replication, and interfering with these targets is the basis for therapeutic interventions. We previously introduced a hypothesis about conformational selection in the protease of dengue virus and related flaviviruses, based on conformational plasticity noted in X-ray structures. The present work presents the first functional evidence for alternate recognition by the dengue protease, in a mechanism based primarily on conformational selection rather than induced-fit. Recognition of distinct substrates and inhibitors in proteolytic and binding assays varies to a different extent, depending on factors reported to influence the protease structure. The pH, salinity, buffer type, and temperature cause a change in binding, proteolysis, or inhibition behavior. Using representative inhibitors with distinct structural scaffolds, we identify two contrasting binding profiles to dengue protease. Noticeable effects are observed in the binding assay upon inclusion of a non-ionic detergent in comparison to the proteolytic assay. The findings highlight the impact of the selection of testing conditions on the observed ligand affinity or inhibitory potency. From a broader scope, the dengue protease presents an example, where the induced-fit paradigm appears insufficient to explain binding events with the biological target. Furthermore, this protein reveals the complexity of comparing or combining biochemical assay data obtained under different conditions. This can be particularly critical for artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in drug discovery that rely on large datasets of compounds activity, compiled from different sources using non-identical testing procedures. In such cases, mismatched results will compromise the model quality and its predictive power. (c) 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This study addressed the complexity of rabies spread by integrating two critical delay effects-vaccination efficacy and incubation duration-into a delay differential equations model, capturing more realistic infection patterns between dogs and humans. To explore the multifaceted drivers of transmission, we applied a novel framework using piecewise derivatives that incorporated singular and non-singular kernels, allowing for nuanced insights into crossover dynamics. The existence and uniqueness of solutions was demonstrated using fixed-point theory within the context of piecewise derivatives and integrals. We employed a piecewise numerical scheme grounded in Newton interpolation polynomials to approximate solutions tailored to handle singular and nonsingular kernels. Additionally, we leveraged artificial neural networks to split the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets, conducting an in-depth analysis across these subsets.

2024.0,diagnosis,Nova Southeastern University; Nova Southeastern University; Nova Southeastern University,"Introduction Malaria is a major public health concern, especially in developing countries. Malaria often presents with recurrent fever, malaise, and other nonspecific symptoms mistaken for influenza. Light microscopy of peripheral blood smears is considered the gold standard diagnostic test for malaria. Delays in malaria diagnosis can increase morbidity and mortality. Microscopy can be time-consuming and limited by skilled labor, infrastructure, and interobserver variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) -based tools for diagnostic screening can automate blood smear analysis without relying on a trained technician. Convolutional neural networks (CNN), deep learning neural networks that can identify visual patterns, are being explored for use in abnormality detection in medical images. A parameter that can be optimized in CNN models is the batch size or the number of images used during model training at once in one forward and backward pass. The choice of batch size in developing CNN -based malaria screening tools can affect model accuracy, training speed, and, ultimately, clinical usability. This study explores the impact of batch size on CNN model accuracy for malaria detection from thin blood smear images. Methods We used the publicly available NIH-NLM-ThinBloodSmearsPf dataset from the United States National Library of Medicine, consisting of blood smear images for Plasmodium falciparum. The collection consists of 13,779 parasitized and 13,779 uninfected single -cell images. We created four datasets containing all images, each with unique randomized subsets of images for model testing. Using Python, four identical 10layer CNN models were developed and trained with varying batch sizes for 10 epochs against all datasets, resulting in 16 sets of outputs. Model prediction accuracy, training time, and F1 -score, an accuracy metric used to quantify model performance, were collected. Results All models produced F1 -scores of 94%-96%, with 10 of 16 instances producing F1 -scores of 95%. After averaging all four dataset outputs by batch size, we observed that, as batch size increased from 16 to 128, the average combined false positives plus false negatives increased by 15.4% (130-150), and the average model F1 -score accuracy decreased by 1% (95.3%-94.3%). The average training time also decreased by 28.11% (1,556-1,119 seconds). Conclusion In each dataset, we observe an approximately 1% decrease in F1 -score as the batch size was increased. Clinically, a 1% deviation at the population level can create a relatively significant impact on outcomes. Results from this study suggest that smaller batch sizes could improve accuracy in models with similar layer complexity and datasets, potentially resulting in better clinical outcomes. Reduced memory requirement for training also means that model training can be achieved with more economical hardware. Our findings suggest that smaller batch sizes could be evaluated for improvements in accuracy to help develop an AI model that could screen thin blood smears for malaria.",DIAGNOSIS,,Exploring the Impact of Batch Size on Deep Learning Artificial Intelligence Models for Malaria Detection,YES
2024.0,prognosis,Ehime University; Ehime University; De La Salle University,"Background Spatiotemporal dengue forecasting using machine learning (ML) can contribute to the development of prevention and control strategies for impending dengue outbreaks. However, training data for dengue incidence may be inflated with frequent zero values because of the rarity of cases, which lowers the prediction accuracy. This study aimed to understand the influence of spatiotemporal resolutions of data on the accuracy of dengue incidence prediction using ML models, to understand how the influence of spatiotemporal resolution differs between quantitative and qualitative predictions of dengue incidence, and to improve the accuracy of dengue incidence prediction with zero-inflated data.Methodology We predicted dengue incidence at six spatiotemporal resolutions and compared their prediction accuracy. Six ML algorithms were compared: generalized additive models, random forests, conditional inference forest, artificial neural networks, support vector machines and regression, and extreme gradient boosting. Data from 2009 to 2012 were used for training, and data from 2013 were used for model validation with quantitative and qualitative dengue variables. To address the inaccuracy in the quantitative prediction of dengue incidence due to zero-inflated data at fine spatiotemporal scales, we developed a hybrid approach in which the second-stage quantitative prediction is performed only when/where the first-stage qualitative model predicts the occurrence of dengue cases.Principal findings At higher resolutions, the dengue incidence data were zero-inflated, which was insufficient for quantitative pattern extraction of relationships between dengue incidence and environmental variables by ML. Qualitative models, used as binary variables, eased the effect of data distribution. Our novel hybrid approach of combining qualitative and quantitative predictions demonstrated high potential for predicting zero-inflated or rare phenomena, such as dengue.Significance Our research contributes valuable insights to the field of spatiotemporal dengue prediction and provides an alternative solution to enhance prediction accuracy in zero-inflated data where hurdle or zero-inflated models cannot be applied. In our study, we tackled the complex challenge of predicting dengue fever outbreaks, a crucial task in the field of epidemiology. Dengue prediction is complicated because it relies on the quality of data, which may be affected by the temporal and spatial resolution. We explored different machine learning algorithms across various spatial (village, city and region) and temporal resolutions (weekly and monthly). A key hurdle we encountered was the high frequency of zero values in reported dengue cases, a common issue known as zero-inflated data. This phenomenon makes accurate predictions difficult, especially at finer resolutions. To overcome this obstacle, we first made qualitative predictions about the presence or absence of dengue cases. Then, in scenarios indicating disease presence, we estimated the magnitude of cases quantitatively. This innovative method we designated as hybrid approach and significantly enhanced prediction accuracy in zero-inflated data. This approach can be applied to continuous data where zero-inflated or hurdle models cannot be applied. Our findings have broader implications beyond dengue prediction, shedding light on the challenges of dealing with zero-inflated data in various real-world situations. By improving our understanding of these complexities, our research contributes valuable insights that not only benefit scientists working in epidemiology but also have practical applications in public health strategies ensuring more effective and targeted interventions.",SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; REGRESSION,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [19KK0107]; JSPS [19H01144]; Endowed Chair Program of the Sumitomo Electric Industries Group Corporate Social Responsibility Foundation,Hybrid Machine Learning Approach to Zero-Inflated Data Improves Accuracy of Dengue Prediction,YES

Demographic information, serological test results, and hematological parameters were used as inputs to the ML models, with the dengue PCR result serving as the output to be predicted. The models used were logistic regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and CatBoost.Results: Of the 300 patients, 184 (61.33%) were PCR positive. Among the total positive cases detected by PCR, 9 (4.89%), 171 (92.93%), and 4 (2.17%) were infected with serotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. A total of 147 (79.89%) males and 37 (20.11%) females were infected, with a mean age of 33 +/- 16 years. In addition, the mean platelet and leukocyte counts and the hematocrit percentages were 75,447%, 4189.02%, and 46.05%, respectively. The SVM was the best-performing ML model for predicting RT-PCR results, with 71.4% accuracy, 97.4% recall, and 71.6% precision. Hyperparameter tuning improved the recall to 100%.Conclusion: Our study documents three circulating serotypes in the capital territory of Pakistan and highlights that the SVM outperformed other models, potentially serving as a valuable tool in clinical settings to aid in the rapid diagnosis of DF.",,,Support Vector Machine Outperforms Other Machine Learning Models in Early Diagnosis of Dengue Using Routine Clinical Data,YES

This strains public health systems and raises the risk of lifelong impairments and disabilities. Worryingly, the three countries most affected by HD witnessed a growth in new cases in 2022, jeopardizing the World Health Organization's targets to interrupt transmission. Artificial intelligence (AI) can help address these challenges by offering the potential for rapid case detection, customized treatment, and solutions for accessibility challenges-especially in regions with a shortage of trained healthcare professionals. This perspective article explores how AI can significantly impact the clinical management of HD, focusing on therapeutic strategies. AI can help classify cases, ensure multidrug therapy compliance, monitor geographical treatment coverage, and detect adverse drug reactions and antimicrobial resistance. In addition, AI can assist in the early detection of nerve damage, which aids in disability prevention and planning rehabilitation. Incorporating AI into mental health counseling is also a promising contribution to combating the stigma associated with HD.

This disease results in a patient's death or incapacity to move their muscles, if it is not appropriately identified in the early stages. A Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) is a frequently used approach to find malaria cells in red blood cells. However, it might not be able to identify infections with small amounts of samples. In the microscopic detection model, blood stains are placed under a microscope for diagnosing malaria. But accurate diagnosis is hard in this method, particularly in developing nations where the disease is most common. The microscopic detection processes are expensive and time-consuming due to the usage of microscopes. The quality of the blood smears and the availability of a qualified specialist, who is skilled in recognizing the disease, impact the accuracy of malaria detection results. The traditional deep learning-based malaria identification models need more processing power. Therefore, a deep learning-based adaptive method is designed to detect malaria cells through the medical image. Hence, the images are gathered from the standard sites and then fed to the segmentation process. Here, the abnormality segmentation is carried out with the help of a developed Trans-MobileUNet + + (T-MUnet + +) network. Trans-MobileUNet + + captures global context, so it is well-suited for segmentation tasks. The segmented image is applied to the adaptive detection phase where the Adaptive and Atrous Convolution-based Recurrent MobilenetV2 (AA-CRMV2) model is designed for the effective recognition of malaria cells. The efficiency of the designed approach is elevated by optimizing the parameters from the AA-CRMV2 network with the help of the Updated Random Parameter-based Fennec Fox Optimization (URP-FFO) algorithm.

We investigated the ability of machine learning to detect DENV based solely on data available at the clinic visit. We extracted symptom and physical exam data from 6,208 pediatric febrile illness visits to Kenyan public health clinics from 2014-2019 and created a dataset with 113 clinical features. Malaria testing was available at the clinic site. DENV testing was performed afterwards.

In the validation dataset, clinician accuracy for diagnosis of malaria was high (82% accuracy, 85% sensitivity, 80% specificity). Accuracy of the models for predicting malaria diagnosis ranged from 53-69% (35-94% sensitivity, 11-80% specificity).

In this study, patterns of mosquito occurrence were analyzed based on landscape and meteorological factors in the metropolitan city of Seoul. We evaluated the influence of environmental factors on mosquito occurrence through the interpretation of prediction models with a machine learning algorithm. Through hierarchical cluster analysis, the study areas were classified into waterside and non-waterside areas, according to the landscape patterns. The mosquito occurrence was higher in the waterside area, and mosquito abundance was negatively affected by rainfall at the waterside. The mosquito occurrence was predicted in each cluster area based on the landscape and cumulative meteorological variables using a random forest algorithm. Both models exhibited good performance (both accuracy and AUROC > 0.8) in predicting the level of mosquito occurrence. The embedded relationship between the mosquito occurrence and the environmental factors in the models was explained using the Shapley additive explanation method. According to the variable importance and the partial dependence plots for each model, the waterside area was more influenced by the meteorological and land cover variables than the non-waterside area.

Diagnostic tools that are affordable and rapid are required for detecting STH. Here, we assessed the performance of the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technique coupled with machine learning algorithms to detect Trichuris muris in faecal, blood, serum samples and non-invasively through the skin of mice.MethodologyWe orally infected 10 mice with 30 T. muris eggs (low dose group), 10 mice with 200 eggs (high dose group) and 10 mice were used as the control group. Using the NIRS technique, we scanned faecal, serum, whole blood samples and mice non-invasively through their skin over a period of 6 weeks post infection. Using artificial neural networks (ANN) and spectra of faecal, serum, blood and non-invasive scans from one experiment, we developed 4 algorithms to differentiate infected from uninfected mice. These models were validated on mice from the second independent experiment.Principal findingsNIRS and ANN differentiated mice into the three groups as early as 2 weeks post infection regardless of the sample used. These results correlated with those from concomitant serological and parasitological investigations.SignificanceTo our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the potential of NIRS as a diagnostic tool for human STH infections. The technique could be further developed for large scale surveillance of soil transmitted helminths in human populations. The existing diagnostic tools for STH infections can be time consuming, expensive, less sensitive and some require trained personnel. These techniques are therefore not feasible for large scale programmatic surveillance. Novel surveillance tools that can be easily scaled up to guide mass drug administration (MDA) for communities at risk remain a priority. This study investigated the role of NIRS as a potential large scale surveillance tool for soil transmitted helminths using Trichiuris muris experimental mouse model. The technique is environmentally friendly because it neither requires reagents nor sample processing procedures to operate and it only takes 5-10 seconds to analyse a sample allowing thousands of samples to be assessed in a day by unskilled personnel.

2023.0,prognosis,Stanford University; Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies,"The spatio-temporal distribution of leishmaniasis, a parasitic vector-borne zoonotic disease, is significantly impacted by land-use change and climate warming in the Americas. However, predicting and containing outbreaks is challenging as the zoonotic Leishmania system is highly complex: leishmaniasis (visceral, cutaneous and muco-cutaneous) in humans is caused by up to 14 different Leishmania species, and the parasite is transmitted by dozens of sandfly species and is known to infect almost twice as many wildlife species. Despite the already broad known host range, new hosts are discovered almost annually and Leishmania transmission to humans occurs in absence of a known host. As such, the full range of Leishmania hosts is undetermined, inhibiting the use of ecological interventions to limit pathogen spread and the ability to accurately predict the impact of global change on disease risk. Here, we employed a machine learning approach to generate trait profiles of known zoonotic Leishmania wildlife hosts (mammals that are naturally exposed and susceptible to infection) and used trait-profiles of known hosts to identify potentially unrecognized hosts. We found that biogeography, phylogenetic distance, and study effort best predicted Leishmania host status. Traits associated with global change, such as agricultural land-cover, urban land-cover, and climate, were among the top predictors of host status. Most notably, our analysis suggested that zoonotic Leishmania hosts are significantly undersampled, as our model predicted just as many unrecognized hosts as unknown hosts. Overall, our analysis facilitates targeted surveillance strategies and improved understanding of the impact of environmental change on local transmission cycles. Author summaryLeishmaniasis is a zoonotic, vector borne disease of poverty with a high burden throughout the Americas: within Latin America there are an estimated 58,500 new cases per year and 54,050 years of life lost due to disability. Although the World Health Organization has targeted leishmaniasis for elimination and control by 2030, the disease remains a persistent threat. Across the Americas, particularly in Central America, the southeastern United States, and perimeters of the Amazon Basin, risk of infection is increasing in geographic extent and elevation. While it is known that Leishmania parasites, the causative agent of leishmaniasis, are maintained in the environment via a mammalian host, the full suite of wildlife hosts has yet to be documented, which significantly hinders control efforts. Here, we use machine learning and ecological and evolutionary trait profiles of known hosts to identify unrecognized potential wildlife hosts of Leishmania. We identify 136 mammals in the Americas that are likely to be exposed to and infected by zoonotic Leishmania in the wild. The high number of unrecognized potential hosts emphasizes a need to better invest in studying the ecological epidemiology of leishmaniasis.

Consequently, the addition of automated detection and classification of malaria using laboratory methods can provide patients with more accurate and faster diagnosis. Therefore, this study used a machine-learning model to predict Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) antigen positivity (presence of malaria) based on sociodemographic behaviour, environment, and clinical features.Method Data from 200 Nigerian patients were used to develop predictive models using nested cross-validation and sequential backward feature selection (SBFS), with 80% of the dataset randomly selected for training and optimisation and the remaining 20% for testing the models. Outcomes were classified as Pf-positive or Pf-negative, corresponding to the presence or absence of malaria, respectively.Results Among the three machine learning models examined, the penalised logistic regression model had the best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the training set (AUC = 84%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 75-93%) and test set (AUC = 83%; 95% CI: 63-100%). Increased odds of malaria were associated with higher body weight (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 4.50, 95% CI: 2.27 to 8.01, p < 0.0001). Even though the association between the odds of having malaria and body temperature was not significant, patients with high body temperature had higher odds of testing positive for the Pf antigen than those who did not have high body temperature (AOR = 1.40, 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.91, p = 0.068). In addition, patients who had bushes in their surroundings (AOR = 2.60, 95% CI: 1.30 to 4.66, p = 0.006) or experienced fever (AOR = 2.10, 95% CI: 0.88 to 4.24, p = 0.099), headache (AOR = 2.07; 95% CI: 0.95 to 3.95, p = 0.068), muscle pain (AOR = 1.49; 95% CI: 0.66 to 3.39, p = 0.333), and vomiting (AOR = 2.32; 95% CI: 0.85 to 6.82, p = 0.097) were more likely to experience malaria.

Generally, virus detection is based on various symptomatic tests and analysis of data samples that contain raw data (blood sample, protein sequence, etc.). Raw data cannot be directly processed by any machine learning (ML) technique. Therefore, feature extraction (FE) techniques are required to generate feature vectors. FE methods yield high dimensional data. Also, ML alone cannot provide accurate results due to large feature vectors. Thus, the feature selection (FS) technique is apt to solve this problem. The paper proposes a feature engineering module in which the FE module is developed and a new FS technique is proposed. The feature engineering module can help in the vaccine development process as accurate disease diagnosis is critical as any vaccine's success depends on precise disease detection. For the first time, this paper uses a metaheuristic method for FS in T-cell prediction.

Detecting the plasmodium parasite requires a skilled examiner and may take up to 10 to 15 minutes to completely go through the whole slide. Due to a lack of skilled medical professionals in the underdeveloped or resource-deficient regions, many cases go misdiagnosed, which results in unavoidable medical complications. We propose to complement the medical professionals by creating a deep learning-based method to automatically detect (localize) the plasmodium parasites in the photograph of stained film. To handle the unbalanced nature of the dataset, we adopt a two-stage approach. Where the first stage is trained to classify cells into just healthy or infected. The second stage is trained to classify each detected cell further into the malaria life-cycle stage.

Thirty-eight thousand cells are tagged from the 345 microscopic images of different Giemsa-stained slides of blood samples. Extensive experimentation is performed using different Convolutional Neural Networks on this dataset. Our experiments and analysis reveal that the two-stage approach works better than the one-stage approach for malaria detection.

Improving existing diagnostic standards with state-of-the-art technology and artificial intelligence has the potential to close this gap. Methodology/Principal findingsWe prototyped an artificial intelligence-based digital pathology (AI-DP) device to explore automated scanning and detection of helminth eggs in stool prepared with the Kato-Katz (KK) technique, the current diagnostic standard for diagnosing soil-transmitted helminths (STHs; Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworms) and Schistosoma mansoni (SCH) infections. First, we embedded a prototype whole slide imaging scanner into field studies in Cambodia, Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania. With the scanner, over 300 KK stool thick smears were scanned, resulting in total of 7,780 field-of-view (FOV) images containing 16,990 annotated helminth eggs (Ascaris: 8,600; Trichuris: 4,083; hookworms: 3,623; SCH: 684). Around 90% of the annotated eggs were used to train a deep learning-based object detection model. From an unseen test set of 752 FOV images containing 1,671 manually verified STH and SCH eggs (the remaining 10% of annotated eggs), our trained object detection model extracted and classified helminth eggs from co-infected FOV images in KK stool thick smears, achieving a weighted average precision (+/- standard deviation) of 94.9% +/- 0.8% and a weighted average recall of 96.1% +/- 2.1% across all four helminth egg species. Conclusions/SignificanceWe present a proof-of-concept for an AI-DP device for automated scanning and detection of helminth eggs in KK stool thick smears. We identified obstacles that need to be addressed before the diagnostic performance can be evaluated against the target product profiles for both STH and SCH. Given that these obstacles are primarily associated with the required hardware and scanning methodology, opposed to the feasibility of AI-based results, we are hopeful that this research can support the 2030 NTDs road map and eventually other poverty-related diseases for which microscopy is the diagnostic standard. Author summaryRecently, the World Health Organization (WHO) published its 2021-2030 road map for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). While diagnostics are clearly pivotal to steer the NTD endemic countries towards the ambitious targets set, the current gap in the global diagnostic armamentarium for NTDs once more becomes painfully apparent. As most NTD programs mainly rely on microscopic examination of slides, automation of slide scanning coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to close this diagnostic gap by 2030. Therefore, we developed a device to automate scanning of stool smears and deployed it in four endemic countries to build an image data base for both intestinal and blood-dwelling worms. After the images were annotated, we used 90% to train and 10% to validate an AI model. As the AI model was able to reliably recognise worm eggs, we provided a proof-of-concept for automated scanning and detection of worm eggs in stool smears. We identified important obstacles for both the slide scanning device and the application of AI, but we are hopeful that this research can support the 2030 NTDs roadmap and eventually other NTDs for which microscopic examination is the diagnostic standard.",INFECTIONS; DIAGNOSIS,,Affordable artificial intelligence-based digital pathology for neglected tropical diseases: A proof-of-concept for the detection of soil-transmitted helminths and Schistosoma mansoni eggs in Kato-Katz stool thick smears,YES

Tuberculosis (TB), malaria and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) count amongst other serious diseases that have had a catastrophic impact on the African continent. Effective responses to such pandemics require high-quality, comprehensive data sets that can inform policymaking and enhance healthcare decision-making. While data is driving the information economy in the 21st century, the scarcity in Africa of carefully curated, large epidemiologic data sources and analytical capacity to rapidly identify and understand emerging infectious diseases poses a major challenge to mounting a time-sensitive response to unfolding pandemics. Data access, sharing and transfer between countries are crucial to effectively managing current and future health pandemics. Data access and sharing, however, raises questions about personal privacy, the adequacy of governance mechanisms to regulate cross-border data flows, and ethical issues relating to the collection and use of personal data in the interests of public health. Sub-Saharan Africa's most research-intensive countries are characterised by diverse data management and privacy governance frameworks.

Therefore, necessitating the need to identify potential biotherapeutic molecules. The study describes the first deep learning (DL)-based computational models for predicting inhibitors of Schistosoma mansoni Thioredoxin glutathione reductase (SmTGR), which is an essential protein for the survival of the helminths in the host. The state-of-the-art performance of DL in similar applications makes it ideal to deploy on bioactive datasets of the SmTGR drug target. Cost-sensitive deep neural network classifiers were trained using the binary classification approach. Based on the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) Curve scores (86.3-86.5%), the five best models generated were able to classify inhibitors with high accuracy (85-90%). Additionally, the DL classifier outperformed random forest by far. This is a proof of concept that deep neural networks can efficiently and robustly classify active schistosomal molecules from inactive. The generated models could be used to screen large-scale compound libraries to prioritize potential inhibitors for experimental characterization.

2022.0,treatment monitoring,Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Purpose Combinations of expressed genes can discriminate radiation-exposed from normal control blood samples by machine learning (ML) based signatures (with 8-20% misclassification rates). These signatures can quantify therapeutically relevant as well as accidental radiation exposures. The prodromal symptoms of acute radiation syndrome (ARS) overlap those present in influenza and dengue fever infections. Surprisingly, these human radiation signatures misclassified gene expression profiles of virally infected samples as false positive exposures. The present study investigates these and other confounders, and then mitigates their impact on signature accuracy. Methods This study investigated recall by previous and novel radiation signatures independently derived from multiple Gene Expression Omnibus datasets on common and rare non-neoplastic blood disorders and blood-borne infections (thromboembolism, S. aureus bacteremia, malaria, sickle cell disease, polycythemia vera, and aplastic anemia). Normalized expression levels of signature genes are used as input to ML-based classifiers to predict radiation exposure in other hematological conditions. Results Except for aplastic anemia, these blood-borne disorders modify the normal baseline expression values of genes present in radiation signatures, leading to false-positive misclassification of radiation exposures in 8-54% of individuals. Shared changes, predominantly in DNA damage response and apoptosis-related gene transcripts in radiation and confounding hematological conditions, compromise the utility of these signatures for radiation assessment. These confounding conditions (sickle cell disease, thrombosis, S. aureus bacteremia, malaria) induce neutrophil extracellular traps, initiated by chromatin decondensation, DNA damage response and fragmentation followed by programmed cell death or extrusion of DNA fragments. Riboviral infections (e.g. influenza or dengue fever) have been proposed to bind and deplete host RNA binding proteins, inducing R-loops in chromatin. R-loops that collide with incoming replication forks can result in incompletely repaired DNA damage, inducing apoptosis and releasing mature virus. To mitigate the effects of confounders, we evaluated predicted radiation-positive samples with novel gene expression signatures derived from radiation-responsive transcripts encoding secreted blood plasma proteins whose expression levels are unperturbed by these conditions. Conclusions This approach identifies and eliminates misclassified samples with underlying hematological or infectious conditions, leaving only samples with true radiation exposures. Diagnostic accuracy is significantly improved by selecting genes that maximize both sensitivity and specificity in the appropriate tissue using combinations of the best signatures for each of these classes of signatures.",PHOSPHORYLATED HISTONE H2AX; DOSE ESTIMATION; CANCER-PATIENTS; STRAND BREAKS; EX-VIVO; IN-VIVO; POPULATION; BIOMARKERS; EXPOSURE; CELLS,University of Western Ontario; CytoGnomix Inc.,Improved radiation expression profiling in blood by sequential application of sensitive and specific gene signatures,YES
2022.0,treatment monitoring,University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Problem definition: Lack of patient adherence to treatment protocols is a main barrier to reducing the global disease burden of tuberculosis (TB). We study the operational design of a treatment adherence support (TAS) platform that requires patients to verify their treatment adherence on a daily basis. Academic/practical relevance: Experimental results on the effectiveness of TAS programs have beenmixed; and rigorous research is needed on how to structure these motivational programs, particularly in resource-limited settings. Our analysis establishes that patient engagement can be increased by personal sponsor outreach and that patient behavior data can be used to identify at-risk patients for targeted outreach. Methodology: We partner with a TB TAS provider and use data from a completed randomized controlled trial. We use administrative variation in the timing of peer sponsor outreach to evaluate the impact of personal messages on subsequent patient verification behavior. We then develop a rolling-horizonmachine learning (ML) framework to generate dynamic risk predictions for patients enrolled on the platform. Results: We find that, on average, sponsor outreach to patients increases the odds ratio of next-day treatment adherence verification by 35%. Furthermore, patients' prior verification behavior can be used to accurately predict short-term(treatment adherence verification) and long-term(successful treatment completion) outcomes. These results allow the provider to target and implement behavioral interventions to at-risk patients. Managerial implications: Our results indicate that, compared with a benchmark policy, the TAS platform could reach the same number of at-risk patients with 6%-40% less capacity, or reach 2%-20% more at-risk patients with the same capacity, by using various ML-based prioritization policies that leverage patient engagement data. Personal sponsor outreach to all patients is likely to be very costly, so targeted TASmay substantially improve the cost-effectiveness of TAS programs.",MEDICATION; MANAGEMENT; OUTCOMES; MALARIA; HEALTH; MODEL,MIT Sloan Health Systems Initiative,Improving Tuberculosis Treatment Adherence Support: The Case for Targeted Behavioral Interventions,YES

Malaria prevention and treatment are also major difficulties in most African countries, and the disease is frequently diagnosed by health workers, particularly microbiologists, using microscopic blood smear samples. As a result, it has put a significant strain on the few medical facilities and health personnel available in most African nations, particularly Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Mozambique, and Niger. Hence, artificial intelligence techniques, particularly deep learning, are increasingly widely employed for disease classification, diagnosis, and prediction. Deep learning predictive models for malaria were developed in this study utilizing a dataset of cell images. The convolutional neural network and ResNet-50 algorithms were used to create malaria models with cell image datasets, and the random rotational image augmentation technique was employed to maintain and optimize the models' performance. The predictive models' performance was evaluated, and the results show that ResNet-50 predictive models outperformed convolutional neural network predictive models in terms of being able to classify and predict infected and uninfected malaria cells with 95% accuracy, as well as correctly predicting negative cases of malaria with 95% accuracy.

Dengue is one of the most rapidly spreading vector-borne infectious diseases. This paper proposes a forecasting model for predicting dengue incidences considering climatic variability across nine cities of Maharashtra state of India over 10 years. The work involves the collection of five climatic factors such as mean minimum temperature, mean maximum temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and mean wind speed for 10 years. Monthly incidences of dengue for the same locations are also collected. Different regression models such as random forest regression, decision trees regression, support vector regress, multiple linear regression, elastic net regression, and polynomial regression are used. Time-series forecasting models such as holt's forecasting, autoregressive, Moving average, ARIMA, SARIMA, and Facebook prophet are implemented and compared to forecast the dengue outbreak accurately. The research shows that humidity and mean maximum temperature are the major climate factors and exhibit strong positive and negative correlation, respectively, with dengue incidences for all locations of Maharashtra state. Mean minimum temperature and rainfall are moderately positively correlated with dengue incidences. Mean wind speed is a less significant factor and is weakly negatively correlated with dengue incidences. Root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R square error (R-2) evaluation metrics are used to compare the performance of the prediction model. Random Forest Regression is the best-fit regression model for five out of nine cities, while Support Vector Regression is for two cities. Facebook Prophet Model is the best fit time series forecasting model for six out of nine cities. Based on the prediction, Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, and Pune are the high-risk regions, especially in August, September, and October.

Recently, an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled ECG algorithm showed excellent accuracy to detect LVSD in a general population, but its accuracy in ChD has not been tested. ObjectiveTo analyze the ability of AI to recognize LVSD in patients with ChD, defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction determined by the Echocardiogram <= 40%. Methodology/principal findingsThis is a cross-sectional study of ECG obtained from a large cohort of patients with ChD named Sao Paulo-Minas Gerais Tropical Medicine Research Center (SaMi-Trop) Study. The digital ECGs of the participants were submitted to the analysis of the trained machine to detect LVSD. The diagnostic performance of the AI-enabled ECG to detect LVSD was tested using an echocardiogram as the gold standard to detect LVSD, defined as an ejection fraction <40%. The model was enriched with NT-proBNP plasma levels, male sex, and QRS >= 120ms.Among the 1,304 participants of this study, 67% were women, median age of 60; there were 93 (7.1%) individuals with LVSD. Most patients had major ECG abnormalities (59.5%). The AI algorithm identified LVSD among ChD patients with an odds ratio of 63.3 (95% CI 32.3-128.9), a sensitivity of 73%, a specificity of 83%, an overall accuracy of 83%, and a negative predictive value of 97%; the AUC was 0.839. The model adjusted for the male sex and QRS >= 120ms improved the AUC to 0.859. The model adjusted for the male sex and elevated NT-proBNP had a higher accuracy of 0.89 and an AUC of 0.874. ConclusionThe AI analysis of the ECG of Chagas disease patients can be transformed into a powerful tool for the recognition of LVSD. Author summaryChagas disease (ChD) is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and continues to be a health problem despite the control of its transmission. ChD is a heterogeneous condition with a wide variation in its clinical course and prognosis. The majority (60%-70%) of infected individuals remain asymptomatic throughout life. Although some develop only conduction defects and mild segmental wall motion abnormalities, others develop severe symptoms of heart failure (HF), thromboembolic phenomena, and life threatening ventricular arrhythmias. HF is one of major causes of the death of patients with ChD. There is some evidence on effective drugs against the parasite in the chronic form of the disease capable of preventing long-term adverse outcomes, but it is still limited. However low-cost medications are able to reduce mortality and improve the quality of life of patients with HF. Because of the lack of tertiary care facilities outside urban centers, an automatic diagnostic tool based on the ECG, which is a relatively simple exam without requiring human interpretation, would improve the capacity to recognize HF. Recently, digital signals of the electrocardiogram were recognized by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and associated with an excellent accuracy for HF in the general population. Our results demonstrate that AI-ECG could ensure a rapid recognition of HF in patients who require a referral to a cardiologist and the use of disease-modifying drugs. AI can be used as a powerful public heath tool, it can transform the lives of 6 million patients with ChD worldwide, and it may well have a formidable impact on patient management and prognosis.",BRAIN NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE; NT-PROBNP; ASSOCIATION; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS; MORTALITY; QRS,"National Institute of Health - NIH [P50 AI098461-02, U19AI098461-06]; CNPq [310679/2016-8, 465518/2014-1]; FAPEMIG [PPM-00428-17, RED-00081-16]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [U19AI098461] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",Left ventricular systolic dysfunction predicted by artificial intelligence using the electrocardiogram in Chagas disease patients-The SaMi-Trop cohort,YES

Female Ae. aegypti mosquito species transmit Zika, Dengue, and Chikungunya. The spread of these diseases correlate positively with the vector population, and this population depends on biotic and abiotic environmental factors including temperature, vegetation condition, humidity and precipitation. To combat virus outbreaks, information about vector population is required. To this aim, Earth observation (EO) data provide fast, efficient and economically viable means to estimate environmental features of interest. In this work, we present a temporal distribution model for adult female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes based on the joint use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, the Normalized Difference Water Index, the Land Surface Temperature (both at day and night time), along with the precipitation information, extracted from EO data. The model was applied separately to data obtained during three different vector control and field data collection condition regimes, and used to explain the differences in environmental variable contributions across these regimes.

Despite an approximately 50% loss in the number of promastigotes in an FD-DAT batch that expired 7 years earlier, the promastigotes maintained a similar morphology to the equivalent valid batch implying most likely that auto-agglutination, rather than aging, is the main reason for expiry. The substitution of normal saline which was initially recommended for reconstitution, by citrate-saline/formaldehyde (CSF) as an anti-clumping/preservative agent resulted in restoration of validity comparable with that of the freeze-dried original or the liquid direct agglutination test (LQ-DAT) version (Friedman ANOVA test = 1.0588; P = 0.5890). Following a similar reconstitution procedure as for the 7-year expired antigen, using significantly lower promastigote concentration (1.4 x 10(7)/mL) than in the non-expired (9.0 x 10(7)/mL), good reliability for VL detection and stability at 4 degrees C (> 12 months) were achieved. In comparison with the original version using normal saline ($32.0/vial), the cost-effectiveness of the FD-DAT was appreciably improved by the CSF incorporation and lowering of promastigote concentration per unit suspension medium ($12.8/vial). With diagnostic reliability comparable with the full-out titration used, FD-DAT procedure based on single sample dilution at the VL cutoff (1:3,200) permitted the use of significantly smaller antigen volumes (0.1 mL vs. > 1.5 mL), therefore contributing to a further reduction in the application cost.

The Zika virus epidemic emerged very rapidly in the susceptible South American population and in many cases immune responses were unable to control the infection. Immune history is a key element of susceptibility or resistance to severe disease. We examined whether pre-existing infection would skew or divert immune resources and might play a role in the severity of Zika infection in the Americas. Using samples from dengue patients and healthy controls from India, we tested functional responses to Zika virus in the context of pre-existing dengue infection. We quantified frequency and functional status of 36 individual cell subsets in depth using advanced profiling techniques and a novel deep learning algorithm. We showed an intact response to new infection with Zika virus which was enriched for early innate immune pathways and robust even during existing dengue infection. Thus, our study suggests that concurrent dengue infection would not be expected to impair immune responses to new infection with Zika virus. The genus Flavivirus contains many mosquito-borne human pathogens of global epidemiological importance such as dengue virus, West Nile virus, and Zika virus, which has recently emerged at epidemic levels. Infections with these viruses result in divergent clinical outcomes ranging from asymptomatic to fatal. Myriad factors influence infection severity including exposure, immune status and pathogen/host genetics. Furthermore, pre-existing infection may skew immune pathways or divert immune resources. We profiled immune cells from dengue virus-infected individuals by multiparameter mass cytometry (CyTOF) to define functional status. Elevations in IFN beta were noted in acute patients across the majority of cell types and were statistically elevated in 31 of 36 cell subsets. We quantified response to in vitro (re)infection with dengue or Zika viruses and detected a striking pattern of upregulation of responses to Zika infection by innate cell types which was not noted in response to dengue virus. Significance was discovered by statistical analysis as well as a neural network-based clustering approach which identified unusual cell subsets overlooked by conventional manual gating. Of public health importance, patient cells showed significant enrichment of innate cell responses to Zika virus indicating an intact and robust anti-Zika response despite the concurrent dengue infection.",WEST-NILE-VIRUS; CD8 T-CELLS; SYSTEMS IMMUNOLOGY; CUMULATIVE INCIDENCE; UNITED-STATES; INFECTION; ANTIBODIES; SUSCEPTIBILITY; TRANSMISSION; ENHANCEMENT,"NIH [AI089992]; Indo-U.S. Vaccine Action Program; Claude D.

2020.0,disease surveillance,Addis Ababa University,"In sub-Saharan Africa, nearly three-fourths of children 6-23 months are anemic. Yet, the underlying causes had not been sufficiently explored. This study, based on data (n = 348) extracted from the Malawi Micronutrient Survey-2015/2016 dataset, evaluated the contribution of multiple factors to the hemoglobin status of children 6-23 months. The association between hemoglobin and 19 predictors was assessed using multiple linear regression analysis, and the relative contribution of the covariates was determined based on delta-R-2 value. The study found that 43.9% of children were anemic and 76.9% had elevated soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) levels. Unit changes in serum ferritin (mu g/L) and sTfR (mg/L) were associated with 0.01 g/dl rise (p = .041) and 0.05 g/dl decline (p < .001) in hemoglobin, respectively. Each 1 ng/ml increase in plasma selenium was met with 0.007 g/dl (p = .02) rise in hemoglobin. Hemoglobin showed negative relationships with alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) (beta = -.339, p = .007) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (beta = -.014, p = .004) and positive association with child's age in months (0 = .038, p = .003) and altitude in meters (beta = .001, p = .015). Children affected by u-thalassemia (beta = -.75, p < .001), malaria (beta = -.43, p = .029), and fever (beta = -.39, p = .008) had significantly lower hemoglobin levels. On the contrary, nine variables including serum zinc and retinol binding protein were not significant predictors of hemoglobin. sTfR had the highest delta-R-2 contribution (9.1%) to hemoglobin variations, followed by inflammation (5.2%), alpha-thalassemia (2.5%), age (2.1%), fever (1.9%), and malaria (1.5%).

2020.0,drug discovery,Central South University; Central South University; Old Dominion University,"Motivation: Determining the structures of proteins is a critical step to understand their biological functions. Crystallography-based X-ray diffraction technique is the main method for experimental protein structure determination. However, the underlying crystallization process, which needs multiple time-consuming and costly experimental steps, has a high attrition rate. To overcome this issue, a series of in silico methods have been developed with the primary aim of selecting the protein sequences that are promising to be crystallized. However, the predictive performance of the current methods is modest. Results: We propose a deep learning model, so-called CLPred, which uses a bidirectional recurrent neural network with long short-term memory (BLSTM) to capture the long-range interaction patterns between k-mers amino acids to predict protein crystallizability. Using sequence only information, CLPred outperforms the existing deep-learning predictors and a vast majority of sequence-based diffraction-quality crystals predictors on three independent test sets. The results highlight the effectiveness of BLSTM in capturing non-local, long-range inter-peptide interaction patterns to distinguish proteins that can result in diffraction-quality crystals from those that cannot. CLPred has been steadily improved over the previous window-based neural networks, which is able to predict crystallization propensity with high accuracy. CLPred can also be improved significantly if it incorporates additional features from pre-extracted evolutional, structural and physicochemical characteristics. The correctness of CLPred predictions is further validated by the case studies of Sox transcription factor family member proteins and Zika virus non-structural proteins.",STRUCTURAL GENOMICS; NS2B-NS3 PROTEASE; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; COMPLEX,NSFC-Zhejiang Joint Fund for the Integration of Industrialization and Informatization [U1909208]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61832019]; 111 Project [B18059]; Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Program [2018WK4001],CLPred: a sequence-based protein crystallization predictor using BLSTM neural network,YES

Despite several efforts of the government and NMHT to eradicate leptospirosis, it remains a public health problem in this province. Modelling and Prediction of this disease may play an important role in reduction of the prevalence. Methods This study aims to model and predict the spatial distribution of leptospirosis utilizing Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as capable approaches. Five environmental parameters of precipitation, temperature, humidity, elevation and vegetation are used for modelling and predicting of the disease. Data of 2009 and 2010 are used for training, and 2011 for testing and evaluating the models. Results Results indicate that utilized approaches in this study can model and predict leptospirosis with high significance level.

A major problem for the available anti-malarial drugs is the occurrence of drug resistance in Plasmodium. Developing of new compounds or modification of existing anti-malarial drugs is an effective approach to face this challenge. Quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) modelling plays an important role in design and modification of anti-malarial compounds by estimation of the activity of the compounds. Methods In this research, the QSAR study was done on anti-malarial activity of 33 imidazolopiperazine compounds based on artificial neural networks (ANN). The structural descriptors of imidazolopiperazine molecules was used as the independents variables and their activity against 3D7 and W2 strains was used as the dependent variables. During modelling process, 70% of compound was used as the training and two 15% of imidazolopiperazines were used as the validation and external test sets. In this work, stepwise multiple linear regression was applied as the valuable selection and ANN with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was utilized as an efficient non-linear approach to correlate between structural information of molecules and their anti-malarial activity. Results The sufficiency of the suggested method to estimate the anti-malarial activity of imidazolopiperazine compounds at two 3D7 and W2 strains was demonstrated using statistical parameters, such as correlation coefficient (R-2), mean square error (MSE). For instance R-train(2) = 0.947, R-val(2) = 0.959, R-test(2) = 0.920 shows the potential of the suggested model for the prediction of 3D7 activity. Different statistical approaches such as and applicability domain (AD) and y-scrambling was also showed the validity of models. Conclusion QSAR can be an efficient way to virtual screening the molecules to design more efficient compounds with activity against malaria (3D7 and W2 strains).

It makes possible to elucidate disease mechanisms, to predict protein functions and to select promising targets for drug development. Currently, several approaches for protein interaction prediction for non-model species incorporate only small fractions of the entire proteomes and their interactions. Based on this perspective, this study presents an integration of computational methodologies, protein network predictions and comparative analysis of the protozoan species Leishmania braziliensis and Leishmania infantum. These parasites cause Leishmaniasis, a worldwide distributed and neglected disease, with limited treatment options using currently available drugs. Results: The predicted interactions were obtained from a meta-approach, applying rigid body docking tests and template-based docking on protein structures predicted by different comparative modeling techniques. In addition, we trained a machine-learning algorithm (Gradient Boosting) using docking information performed on a curated set of positive and negative protein interaction data. Our final model obtained an AUC = 0.88, with recall = 0.69, specificity = 0.88 and precision = 0.83. Using this approach, it was possible to confidently predict 681 protein structures and 6198 protein interactions for L. braziliensis, and 708 protein structures and 7391 protein interactions for L. infantum. The predicted networks were integrated to protein interaction data already available, analyzed using several topological features and used to classify proteins as essential for network stability.

Methods: We used pre-intervention site-level occurrence data from 1192 survey sites collected during extensive mapping surveys by the Nigeria Ministry of Health. Using an ensemble of machine learning modelling algorithms (generalised boosted models and random forest), we mapped the ecological niche of LF at a spatial resolution of 1 km(2). By overlaying gridded estimates of population density, we estimated the human population living in LF risk areas on a 100 x 100 m scale. Results: Our maps demonstrate that there is a heterogeneous distribution of LF risk areas across Nigeria, with large portions of northern Nigeria having more environmentally suitable conditions for the occurrence of LF. Here we estimated that approximately 110 million individuals live in areas at risk of LF transmission.

2017.0,disease surveillance,University of Manchester; University of Oxford,"Background: Childhood pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of mortality in children younger than 5 years old. Recent updates to World Health Organization pneumonia guidelines recommend outpatient care for a population of children previously classified as high risk. This revision has been challenged by policymakers in Africa, where mortality related to pneumonia is higher than in other regions and often complicated by comorbidities. This study aimed to identify factors that best discriminate inpatient mortality risk in non-severe pneumonia and explore whether these factors offer any added benefit over the current criteria used to identify children with pneumonia requiring inpatient care. Methods: We undertook a retrospective cohort study of children aged 2-59 months admitted with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia at 14 public hospitals in Kenya between February 2014 and February 2016. Using machine learning techniques, we analysed whether clinical characteristics and common comorbidities increased the risk of inpatient mortality for non-severe pneumonia. The topmost risk factors were subjected to decision curve analysis to explore if using them as admission criteria had any net benefit above the current criteria. Results: Out of 16,162 children admitted with pneumonia during the study period, 10,687 were eligible for subsequent analysis. Inpatient mortality within this non-severe group was 252/10,687 (2.36%). Models demonstrated moderately good performance; the partial least squares discriminant analysis model had higher sensitivity for predicting mortality in comparison to logistic regression. Elevated respiratory rate (>= 70 bpm), age 2-11 months and weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ) <-3SD were highly discriminative of mortality. These factors ranked consistently across the different models. For a risk threshold probability of 7-14%, there is a net benefit to admitting the patient sub-populations with these features as additional criteria alongside those currently used to classify severe pneumonia. Of the population studied, 70.54% met at least one of these criteria. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the overall results were not significantly affected by variations in pneumonia severity classification criteria.

Here, we used a machine learning technique, namely Radial Basis Artificial Neural Network, to assess whether parasite load could be learned from clinical data (serological test, biochemical markers and physical signs). By comparing 18 different combinations of input clinical data, we found that parasite load can be accurately predicted using a relatively small reference set of 35 naturally infected dogs and 20 controls. In the best case scenario (use of all clinical data), predictions presented no bias or inflation and an accuracy (i.e., correlation between true and predicted values) of 0.869, corresponding to an average error of 38.2 parasites per unit of volume. We conclude that reasonable estimates of L infantum load from lymph node aspirates can be obtained from clinical records when qPCR services are not available. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of this disease are much more profound in third world countries, which have very limited medical resources. When an intense outbreak occurs, most of these countries cannot cope with the high number of patients due to the lack of medicine, equipment and hospital facilities. The prevention or reduction of the risk factor of this disease is very challenging, especially in third world countries, due to poverty and economic insatiability. Technology can offer alternative solutions by providing early detection mechanisms that help to control the spread of the disease and allow the management of treatment facilities in advance to ensure a more timely health service, which can save thousands of lives. In this study, we have deployed an intelligent malaria outbreak early warning system, which is a mobile application that predicts malaria outbreak based on climatic factors using machine learning algorithms. The system will help hospitals, healthcare providers, and health organizations take precautions in time and utilize their resources in case of emergency. To our best knowledge, the system developed in this paper is the first publicly available application. Since confounding effects of climatic factors have a greater influence on the incidence of malaria, we have also conducted extensive research on exploring a new ecosystem model for the assessment of hidden ecological factors and identified three confounding factors that significantly influence the malaria incidence. Additionally, we deploy a smart healthcare application; this paper also makes a significant contribution by identifying hidden ecological factors of malaria.",HUMAN HEALTH; NUMBER,"National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP); Tertiary Education Trust Fund (tetFund), Nigeria; Innovate UK [KTP010551]",Towards a Predictive Analytics-Based Intelligent Malaria Outbreak Warning System,YES

Understanding the intricate relationship between environmental factors and malaria incidence is essential for effective control and elimination strategies. Study design: Cohort study. Methods: This cohort study, conducted between Jan 2016 and October 2021 across three districts in southeastern Tanzania, utilized advanced machine learning techniques, specifically the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, to examine the impact of climate factors on malaria incidence. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were applied to interpret model predictions, highlighting the roles of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), temperature, and rainfall in shaping malaria transmission dynamics. Results: Analysis revealed considerable heterogeneity in malaria incidence across southeastern Tanzania, with Kibiti experiencing the highest number of cases (15,308) over the study period. Seasonal peaks corresponded with rainy periods, though incidence rates varied by district. Incorporating lagged climate variables and seasonal trends significantly improved forecast accuracy, with the one-month lag model achieving the lowest mean absolute error (MAE = 175.46) and root mean squared error (RMSE = 228.24). SHAP analysis identified seasonality (mean SHAP 29.6), followed by lagged temperature (13.8), rainfall (12.4), and NDVI (5.96), as the most influential factors, reflecting the biological underpinnings of malaria transmission. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the utility of machine learning and explainable SHAP in malaria epidemiology, providing a data-driven framework to guide targeted, climate-informed malaria control strategies.

The miLab MAL, an automated artificial intelligence-driven instrument was compared with standard microscopy at LabCorp reference laboratories. Four hundred eight samples submitted for parasitic examination were prepared with thick and thin smears and Noul's malaria platform miLab MAL, and evaluated for positivity, negativity, percent positivity, and species identification. Of 408 samples, 399 samples were manually negative, while 397 were negative by miLab MAL. Two samples initially classified as negative manually were found positive by miLab MAL. In all nine cases, Plasmodium falciparum was identified by both methods. Percentage parasitemia was higher in the manually calculated method, especially when >1%. miLab MAL was accurate in identifying the absence of Plasmodium falciparum and exhibited higher sensitivity than the manual method. All positive samples detected by microscopy were also identifiedwith miLab MAL. All positive Plasmodium cases were correctly identified by miLab MAL. However, the number of positive samples was limited to only Plasmodium falciparum. Although parasitemia by the manual method was on average six times higher than with miLab MAL, this may be due to sampling variability. The findings show that miLab MAL can be used to screen out negative Plasmodium falciparum samples.

This study introduces an automated system for analyzing Romanowsky-stained thick blood smears, focusing on image quality evaluation, leukocyte detection, and malaria parasite classification. Using a dataset of 1000 clinically diagnosed images, we applied feature extraction techniques, including histogram bins and texture analysis with the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), alongside support vector machines (SVMs), for image quality assessment. Leukocyte detection employed optimal thresholding segmentation utility (OTSU) thresholding, binary masking, and erosion, followed by the connected components algorithm. Parasite detection used high-intensity region selection and adaptive bounding boxes, followed by a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) for candidate identification. A second CNN classified parasites into trophozoites, schizonts, and gametocytes. The system achieved an F1-score of 95% for image quality evaluation, 88.92% for leukocyte detection, and 82.10% for parasite detection. The F1-score-a metric balancing precision (correctly identified positives) and recall (correctly detected instances out of actual positives)-is especially valuable for assessing models on imbalanced datasets.

Conventional treatments, including Glucantime, are hindered by drug resistance and adverse effects, highlighting the need for effective natural alternatives. This study investigates the in vitro and ex vivo anti-leishmanial effects of hydroalcoholic tobacco leaf extract (Nicotiana tabacum) against L. major. Methods: A 70 % hydroalcoholic extract of tobacco leaves was prepared and tested at concentrations of 12.5, 50, 100, and 200 mg/mL. In vitro assays evaluated promastigote mortality, while ex vivo assays assessed macrophage infection rates. Glucantime served as the positive control. Evaluations were conducted at 24, 48, and 72 h, with data analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test. Results: The tobacco extract demonstrated a dose- and time-dependent reduction in promastigote mortality and amastigote infection rates. At 200 mg/mL, its efficacy was comparable to 100 mg/mL Glucantime, particularly after 72 h. Higher extract concentrations significantly reduced both parasite viability and macrophage infection rates, suggesting its potential as a potent anti-leishmanial agent. Conclusion: Hydroalcoholic tobacco leaf extract shows promising anti-leishmanial activity in vitro and ex vivo, suggesting its potential as a natural alternative to conventional treatments like Glucantime.

The presence of rouleaux formation indicates either a bacterial infection, connective tissue disease, chronic liver disease, multiple myeloma or diabetes among others, it is a highly common occurrence in malaria infected patients and according to the international council for standardization of hematology (ICSH), microscopists are mandated to report its presence. Hence to develop unbiased automated malaria diagnostic systems capable of being deployed in malaria endemic regions, these systems need to be capable of identifying rouleaux formation and detecting malaria parasite within such type of RBC.

Without early and proper diagnosis, it leads to organ failure, coma and eventually death. The gold standard technique of diagnosing malaria is the thick and thin blood smear microscopy which entails the visual inspection of a blood smear slide under a microscope for detecting malaria parasites which inhibit the red blood cells (RBC). This technique is highly subjective, tedious and time consuming, it also requires expert skill in malaria microscopy which is highly lacking in malaria endemic regions. To tackle these drawbacks, a lot of studies have automated the process using Artificial Intelligence, but these systems focus on the detection of malaria parasites only. Clinical microscopy for diagnosing malaria goes beyond detecting parasites in blood smears, other abnormalities seen by the microscopists are recorded as well. One such common abnormality is the rouleaux formation, which is the stacking of red blood cells like chains of coins, its presence indicates the presence of an infection.

The primary goal of this research is to forecast the occurrence of dengue disease in the city of Dhaka using methods from machine learning and time series analysis and then to compare the models in order to find the one with the lowest MAPE. From January 2016 through July 2021, monthly data were retrieved for this study from WHO and the Directorate General of Health and Services (DGHS). According to the findings of this research, neural networks outperform time series analysis when it comes to making predictions. The best-fitted neural network (NN) model was found in model 04 with 05 hidden layers which produced the minimum error model with the value of error 0.003032557, and the values of RMSE and MAPE are 7.588889e - 06 and 1.15273, respectively, for the prediction of the dengue fever in Dhaka city. In contrast, the original dengue data in the time series analysis is not stationary. Take the difference and run the unit root test by the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to make it stationary. The dengue data series is stationary at the first-order difference, as evidenced by the ACF and PACF, which show no noticeable spike in the first-order difference. The ARIMA (6, 1, 1) model with the lowest AIC = -251.8, RMSE = 0.0310797, and MAPE = 15.2892 is the best choice model for predicting the dengue death rate. Therefore, from these two models, the NN model gives better prediction performance with the lowest value of MAPE. So, the neural network gives better prediction performance than time series analysis. The NN model forecasted 12-month death rates of dengue fever that suggest the death rate in dengue fever falling month by month. This study is more innovative than any other research because this research approach is different from any other research approach. The model selection criteria are based on the most effective performance metrics MAPE, indicating the lowest error and better prediction performance.

The early and accurate detection of this disease is crucial to reducing the number of deaths it causes. However, the current method of detecting malaria parasites involves manual examination of blood smears, which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, mainly performed by skilled hematologists, especially in underdeveloped countries. To address this problem, we have developed two deep learning -based systems, YOLO-SPAM and YOLO-SPAM++, which can detect the parasites responsible for malaria at an early stage. Our evaluation of these systems using two public datasets of malaria parasite images, MP-IDB and IML, shows that they outperform the current state-ofthe-art, with more than 11M fewer parameters than the baseline YOLOv5m6. YOLO-SPAM++ demonstrated a substantial 10% improvement over YOLO-SPAM and up to 20% against the best -performing baseline in preliminary experiments conducted on the Plasmodium Falciparum species of MP-IDB.

Methods In this research, we introduce LeishFuNet, a deep learning framework designed for detecting Leishmania parasites in microscopic images. To enhance the performance of our model through same-domain transfer learning, we initially train four distinct models: VGG19, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet 169 on a dataset related to another infectious disease, COVID-19. These trained models are then utilized as new pre-trained models and fine-tuned on a set of 292 self-collected high-resolution microscopic images, consisting of 138 positive cases and 154 negative cases. The final prediction is generated through the fusion of information analyzed by these pre-trained models.

Predicting infectious disease outbreaks on a countrywide scale is complex due to spatiotemporal variations in dengue incidence across administrative areas. To address this, we propose a machine learning ensemble model for forecasting the dengue incidence rate (DIR) in Brazil, with a focus on the population under 19 years old. The model integrates spatial and temporal information, providing one-month-ahead DIR estimates at the state level. Comparative analyses with a dummy model and ablation studies demonstrate the ensemble model's qualitative and quantitative efficacy across the 27 Brazilian Federal Units. Furthermore, we showcase the transferability of this approach to Peru, another Latin American country with differing epidemiological characteristics. This timely forecast system can aid local governments in implementing targeted control measures. The study advances climate services for health by identifying factors triggering dengue outbreaks in Brazil and Peru, emphasizing collaborative efforts with intergovernmental organizations and public health institutions. The innovation lies not only in the algorithms themselves but in their application to a domain marked by data scarcity and operational scalability challenges. We bridge the gap by integrating well-curated ground data with advanced analytical methods, addressing a significant deficiency in current practices. The successful transfer of the model to Peru and its consistent performance during the 2019 outbreak in Brazil showcase its scalability and practical application. While acknowledging limitations in handling extreme values, especially in regions with low DIR, our approach excels where accurate predictions are critical. The study not only contributes to advancing DIR forecasting but also represents a paradigm shift in integrating advanced analytics into public health operational frameworks. This work, driven by a collaborative spirit involving intergovernmental organizations and public health institutions, sets a precedent for interdisciplinary collaboration in addressing global health challenges.

The World Health Organization has set a goal to halve the deaths and disabilities related to snakebite envenoming by 2030. However, significant challenges in achieving this goal include a lack of robust research evidence related to snakebite incidence and treatment, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. This study aimed to combine established methodologies with the latest tools in Artificial Intelligence to assess the barriers to effective snakebite treatment in Ghana.Method We used a MaxDiff statistical experiment design to collect data, and six supervised machine learning models were applied to predict responses whose performance showed an advantage over the other through 6921 data points partitioned using the hold-back validation method, with 70% training and 30% validation. The results were compared using key metrics: Akaike Information Criterion corrected, Bayesian Information Criterion, Root Average Squared Error, and Fit Time in milliseconds.Results Considering all the responses, none of the six machine learning algorithms proved superior, but the Generalized Regression Model (Ridge) performed consistently better among the candidate models. The model consistently predicted several key significant barriers to effective snakebite treatment, such as the high cost of antivenoms, increased use of unorthodox, harmful practices, lack of access to effective antivenoms in remote areas when needed, and resorting to unorthodox and harmful practices in addition to hospital treatment.Conclusion The combination of a MaxDiff statistical experiment design to collect data and six machine learning models allowed the identification of barriers to accessing effective therapies for snakebite envenoming in Ghana. Addressing these barriers through targeted policy interventions, including intensified advocacy, continuous education, community engagement, healthcare worker training, and strategic investments, can enhance the effectiveness of snakebite treatment, ultimately benefiting snakebite victims and reducing the burden of snakebite envenoming.

To examine the eye for signs of active trachoma, healthcare providers typically look for clusters of five or more follicles on the conjunctiva of the upper eyelid for the follicular inflammatory trachoma stage. However, it is also possible to find individual follicles scattered throughout the conjunctiva, particularly in mild or early-stage trachoma cases. Additionally, the datasets are photographic images collected in the field that can be high-dimensional and may contain large amounts of redundant information. We propose integrating novel attention-based feature extraction and feature selection techniques to address these challenges. First, we present the Lambda layer within the Convolutional Block Attention Module (L-CBAM) to normalize attention weights and improve the feature extraction process. Second, we introduce an adaptive mechanism, Adaptive Beta Hill Climbing (A beta HC) with Social Ski-Driver (SSD), which adjusts the exploration-exploitation trade-off during the search process, allowing for better exploration of the search space and more efficient convergence toward an optimal feature subset. We then use the multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier to produce final classification results using selected subsets.

It is a significant public health problem and accounts for many deaths globally. Implementing more effective methods that can more accurately detect dengue cases is challenging. The theme of this digital pathology-associated research is automatic dengue detection from peripheral blood smears (PBS) employing deep learning (DL) techniques. In recent years, DL has been significantly employed for automated computer-assisted diagnosis of various diseases from medical images. This paper explores pre-trained convolution neural networks (CNNs) for automatic dengue fever detection. Transfer learning (TL) is executed on three state-of-the-art CNNs - ResNet50, MobileNetV3Small, and MobileNetV3Large, to customize the models for differentiating the dengue-infected blood smears from the healthy ones. The dataset used to design and test the models contains 100x magnified dengue-infected and healthy control digital microscopic PBS images. The models are validated with a 5-fold cross-validation framework and tested on unseen data. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM), is eventually applied to the models to allow visualization of the precise regions on the smears most instrumental in making the predictions. While all three transferred pre-trained CNN models performed well (above 98% overall classification accuracy), MobileNetV3Small is the recommended model for this classification problem due to its significantly less computationally demanding characteristics. Transferred pre-trained CNN based on MobileNetV3Small yielded Accuracy, Recall, Specificity, Precision, F1 Score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.982 +/- 0.011, 0.973 +/- 0.027, 0.99 +/- 0.013, 0.989 +/- 0.015, 0.981 +/- 0.012 and 0.982 +/- 0.012 respectively, averaged over the five folds on the unseen dataset.

Early and accurate diagnosis is essential for controlling the disease's spread and avoiding severe health complications. Manual examination of blood smear samples by skilled technicians is a time-consuming aspect of the conventional malaria diagnosis toolbox. Malaria persists in many parts of the world, emphasising the urgent need for sophisticated and automated diagnostic instruments to expedite the identification of infected cells, thereby facilitating timely treatment and reducing the risk of disease transmission. This study aims to introduce a more lightweight and quicker model-but with improved accuracy-for diagnosing malaria using a YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once v. 4) deep learning object detector. Methods The YOLOv4 model is modified using direct layer pruning and backbone replacement. The primary objective of layer pruning is the removal and individual analysis of residual blocks within the C3, C4 and C5 (C3-C5) Res-block bodies of the backbone architecture's C3-C5 Res-block bodies. The CSP-DarkNet53 backbone is simultaneously replaced for enhanced feature extraction with a shallower ResNet50 network. The performance metrics of the models are compared and analysed. Results The modified models outperform the original YOLOv4 model. The YOLOv4-RC3_4 model with residual blocks pruned from the C3 and C4 Res-block body achieves the highest mean accuracy precision (mAP) of 90.70%. This mAP is > 9% higher than that of the original model, saving approximately 22% of the billion floating point operations (B-FLOPS) and 23 MB in size. The findings indicate that the YOLOv4-RC3_4 model also performs better, with an increase of 9.27% in detecting the infected cells upon pruning the redundant layers from the C3 Res-block bodies of the CSP-DarkeNet53 backbone. Conclusions The results of this study highlight the use of the YOLOv4 model for detecting infected red blood cells. Pruning the residual blocks from the Res-block bodies helps to determine which Res-block bodies contribute the most and least, respectively, to the model's performance. Our method has the potential to revolutionise malaria diagnosis and pave the way for novel deep learning-based bioinformatics solutions.

The existing mosquito control measures, such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), helped to reduce the infections. However, mosquito-borne diseases are still among the deadliest diseases, forcing us to improve the existing control methods and look for alternative methods simultaneously. Advanced monitoring techniques, including remote sensing, and geographic information systems (GIS) have significantly enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of mosquito control measures. Mosquitoes' behavioural traits, such as locomotion, blood-feeding, and fertility are the key determinants of disease transmission and epidemiology. Technological advancements, such as high-resolution cameras, infrared imaging, and artificial intelligence (AI) driven object detection models, including groundbreaking convolutional neural networks, have provided efficient and precise options to monitor various mosquito behaviours, including locomotion, oviposition, fertility, and host-seeking. However, they are not commonly employed in mosquito-based research. This review highlights the novel and significant advancements in behaviour-monitoring tools, mostly from the last decade, due to cutting-edge video monitoring technology and artificial intelligence. These advancements can offer enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and the ability to quickly process large volumes of data, enabling detailed behavioural analysis over extended periods and large sample sizes, unlike traditional manual methods prone to human error and labour-intensive. The use of behaviour-assaying techniques can support or replace existing monitoring techniques and directly contribute to improving control measures by providing more accurate and real-time data on mosquito activity patterns and responses to interventions. This enhanced understanding can help establish the role of behavioural changes in improving epidemiological models, making them more precise and dynamic. As a result, mosquito management strategies can become more adaptive and responsive, leading to more effective and targeted interventions.

This study suggests a novel and highly effective automated diagnostic approach that employs deep-learning object detectors to improve the accuracy and efficiency of malaria-infected cell detection and Plasmodium species classification to overcome these challenges. Plasmodium parasites were detected within thin blood stain images using the YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 models, which were optimized for this purpose. YOLOv5 obtains a slightly higher accuracy on the source dataset (mAP@ 0.5=96 %) than YOLOv4 (mAP@ 0.5=89 %), but YOLOv4 exhibits superior robustness and generalization across diverse datasets, as demonstrated by its performance on an independent validation set (mAP@ 0.5=90 %). This robustness emphasizes the dependability of YOLOv4 for deployment in a variety of clinical settings. Furthermore, an automated process was implemented to produce bound single-cell images from YOLOv4's localization outputs, thereby eradicating the necessity for conventional and time-consuming segmentation methods. The DenseNet-121 model, which was optimized for species identification, obtained an impressive overall accuracy of 95.5% in the subsequent classification stage, indicating excellent generalization across all malaria species.

We used epidemiological data from the Colombian Public Health Surveillance System (January 2007 to December 2019). Environmental data were obtained from remote sensing sources including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. Data on population were obtained from the TerriData dataset. We implemented a causal inference approach using a machine learning algorithm to estimate the causal association of the environmental variables on the monthly occurrence of excess cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The results showed that the largest causal association corresponded to soil moisture with a lag of 3 months, with an average increase of 8.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.7-8.3%) in the occurrence of excess cases. The temperature-related variables (air temperature and soil temperature) had a positive causal effect on the excess cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis. It is noteworthy that rainfall did not have a statistically significant causal effect. This information could potentially help to monitor and control cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia, providing estimates of causal effects using remote sensor variables.",ENDEMIC AREA; RISK-FACTORS; CLIMATE; INFERENCE; IRAN,,Causal association between environmental variables and the excess cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia: are we looking to the wrong side?,YES

It is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite transmitted by blood-sucking triatomine bugs. Automated identification of triatomine bugs is a potential means to strengthen CD vector surveillance. To be broadly useful, however, automated systems must draw on algorithms capable of correctly identifying bugs from images taken with ordinary cellphone cameras at varying angles or positions. Here, we assess the performance of five machine-learning algorithms at identifying the main CD vector genera (Triatoma, Panstrongylus, and Rhodnius) based on bugs photographed at different angles/positions with a 72-dpi cellphone camera. Each bug (N = 730; 13 species) was photographed at nine angles representing three positions: dorsal-flat, dorsal-oblique, and front/back-oblique. We randomly split the 6570-picture database into training (80%) and testing sets (20%), and then trained and tested a convolutional neural network (AlexNet, AN); three boosting-based classifiers (AdaBoost, AB; Gradient Boosting, GB; and Histogram-based Gradient Boosting, HB); and a linear discriminant model (LD). We assessed identification accuracy and specificity with logit-binomial generalized linear mixed models fit in a Bayesian framework. Differences in performance across algorithms were mainly driven by AN's essentially perfect accuracy and specificity, irrespective of picture angle or bug position. HB predicted accuracies ranged from similar to 0.987 (Panstrongylus, dorsal-oblique) to >0.999 (Triatoma, dorsal-flat). AB accuracy was poor for Rhodnius (similar to 0.224-0.282) and Panstrongylus (similar to 0.664-0.729), but high for Triatoma (similar to 0.988-0.991). For Panstrongylus, LD and GB had predicted accuracies in the similar to 0.970-0.984 range. AB misclassified similar to 57% of Rhodnius and Panstrongylus as Triatoma, whereas specificity ranged from similar to 0.92 to similar to 1.0 for the remaining algorithm-genus combinations. Dorsal-flat pictures appeared to improve algorithm performance slightly, but angle/position effects were overall weak-to-negligible. We conclude that, when high-performance algorithms such as AN are used, the angles or positions at which bugs are photographed seem unlikely to hinder cellphone picture-based automated identification of CD vectors, at least at the genus level. Future research should focus on combining mixed-quality pictures and state-of-the-art algorithms to (i) identify triatomine adults to the species level and (ii) distinguish triatomine nymphs (i.e., immature stages) from adults and from other insects.",SURVEILLANCE; TRANSMISSION; RECOGNITION; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY; MODELS,"Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES, Brazil) [001]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq, Brazil) [301904/2018-9, 426619/2018-8]; US National Science Foundation (NSF, United States of America) [OIA-1920946]","Cellphone picture-based, genus-level automated identification of Chagas disease vectors: Effects of picture orientation on the performance of five machine-learning algorithms",YES

2024.0,prognosis,Mohammed V University in Rabat,"Rabies is a major zoonotic disease legally notifiable in Morocco and elsewhere. Given the burden of rabies and its impact on public health, several national control programs have been implemented since 1986, without achieving their expected objectives. The aim of this study was to design a predictive analysis of rabies in Morocco. The expected outcome was the construction of probabilistic diagrams that can guide actions for the integrated control of this disease, involving all stakeholders, in the country. Such modeling is an essential step in operational epidemiology to optimize expenditure of public funds allocated to the integrated strategy for fighting this disease. The methodology employed combined the use of geospatial analysis tools (kriging) and artificial intelligence models (Machine Learning). In order to investigate the link between the risk of rabies within a territorial municipality (commune) and its socio-economic situation, the following data were analyzed: (1) health data: reported animal cases of rabies between 2004 and 2021 and data obtained through the ArcGIS kriging tool (Geospatial data); (2) demographic and socio-economic data. We compared several Machine Learning models. Of these, the Imbalanced-Xgboost model associated with kriging yielded the best results. After optimizing this model, we mapped our results for better visualization. The obtained results complement and consolidate previous study in this field with greater accuracy, showing a strong correlation between a commune's socio-economic status, its geographical location and its risk level of rabies. From this, 399 out of the 1546 communes have been identified as high-risk areas, accounting for 25.8% of the total number of communes. Under this risk-based approach, the results of these analyses make it practical to take targeted decisions for rabies prevention and control, as well as canine population control, in a territorial commune according to its risk level. Such an approach allows obvious optimized distribution of financial resources and adaptation of the control actions to be taken. The study highlights also the importance of using innovative technologies to refine epidemiological approaches and fill gaps in field data. Through this study, we hope to contribute to eradication of rabies in Morocco by providing reliable data and practical recommendations for control actions against rabies.",,,Contribution of artificial intelligence for understanding animal rabies epidemiology in Morocco: What are the perspectives of an innovative and predictive approaches?,YES

Current diagnostics based on parasite egg detection in stool detect infection only at a late stage, and current antibody-based tests cannot distinguish past from current infection. Here, we developed and used a multiplexed antibody profiling platform to obtain a comprehensive repertoire of antihelminth humoral profiles including isotype, subclass, Fc receptor (FcR) binding, and glycosylation profiles of antigen-specific antibodies. Using Essential Regression (ER) and SLIDE, interpretable machine learning methods, we identified latent factors (context-specific groups) that move beyond biomarkers and provide insights into the pathophysiology of different stages of schistosome infection. By comparing profiles of infected and healthy individuals, we identified modules with unique humoral signatures of active disease, including hallmark signatures of parasitic infection such as elevated immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4). However, we also captured previously uncharacterized humoral responses including elevated FcR binding and specific antibody glycoforms in patients with active infection, helping distinguish them from those without active infection but with equivalent antibody titers. This signature was validated in an independent cohort. Our approach also uncovered two distinct endotypes, nonpatent infection and prior infection, in those who were not actively infected. Higher amounts of IgG1 and FcR1/FcR3A binding were also found to be likely protective of the transition from nonpatent to active infection. Overall, we unveiled markers for antibody-based diagnostics and latent factors underlying the pathogenesis of schistosome infection.

2024.0,diagnosis,Ziauddin University,"Evolution remains an incessant process in viruses, allowing them to elude the host immune response and induce severe diseases, impacting the diagnostic and vaccine effectiveness. Emerging and re-emerging diseases are among the significant public health concerns globally. The revival of dengue is mainly due to the potential for naturally arising mutations to induce genotypic alterations in serotypes. These transformations could lead to future outbreaks, underscoring the significance of studying DENV evolution in endemic regions. Predicting the emerging Dengue Virus (DENV) genome is crucial as the virus disrupts host cells, leading to fatal outcomes. Deep learning has been applied to predict dengue fever cases; there has been relatively less emphasis on its significance in forecasting emerging DENV serotypes. While Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) were initially designed for modeling temporal sequences, our proposed DL-DVE generative and classification model, trained on complete genome data of DENV, transcends traditional approaches by learning semantic relationships between nucleotides in a continuous vector space instead of representing the contextual meaning of nucleotide characters. Leveraging 2000 publicly available DENV complete genome sequences, our Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based generative and Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) based classification DL-DVE model showcases proficiency in learning intricate patterns and generating sequences for emerging serotype of DENV. The generated sequences were analyzed along with available DENV serotype sequences to find conserved motifs in the genome through MEME Suite (version 5.5.5). The generative model showed an accuracy of 93 %, and the classification model provided insight into the specific serotype label, corroborated by BLAST search verification. Evaluation metrics such as ROC-AUC value 0.818, accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, all to be around 99.00 %, demonstrating the classification model's reliability. Our model classified the generated sequences as DENV-4, exhibiting 65.99 % similarity to DENV-4 and around 63-65 % similarity with other serotypes, indicating notable distinction from other serotypes.

Out of the 30 Leishmania species, 21 species cause human infection that affect the skin and the internal organs. Around, 700,000 to 1,000,000 of the newly infected cases and 26,000 to 65,000 deaths are reported worldwide annually. The disease exhibits three clinical presentations, namely, the cutaneous, muco-cutaneous and visceral Leishmaniasis which affects the skin, mucosal membrane and the internal organs, respectively. The relapsing behavior of the disease limits its diagnosis and treatment efficiency. The common diagnostic approaches follow subjective, error-prone, repetitive processes. Despite, an ever pressing need for an accurate detection of Leishmaniasis, the research conducted so far is scarce. In this regard, the main aim of the current research is to develop an artificial intelligence based detection tool for the Leishmaniasis from the Geimsa-stained microscopic images using deep learning method.Methods Stained microscopic images were acquired locally and labeled by experts. The images were augmented using different methods to prevent overfitting and improve the generalizability of the system. Fine-tuned Faster RCNN, SSD, and YOLOV5 models were used for object detection. Mean average precision (MAP), precision, and Recall were calculated to evaluate and compare the performance of the models.Results The fine-tuned YOLOV5 outperformed the other models such as Faster RCNN and SSD, with the MAP scores, of 73%, 54% and 57%, respectively.Conclusion The currently developed YOLOV5 model can be tested in the clinics to assist the laboratorists in diagnosing Leishmaniasis from the microscopic images. Particularly, in low-resourced healthcare facilities, with fewer qualified medical professionals or hematologists, our AI support system can assist in reducing the diagnosing time, workload, and misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the dataset collected by us will be shared with other researchers who seek to improve upon the detection system of the parasite. The current model detects the parasites even in the presence of the monocyte cells, but sometimes, the accuracy decreases due to the differences in the sizes of the parasite cells alongside the blood cells.

Early diagnosis and treatment of each imported malaria case is the key to successfully maintaining malaria elimination success. This study aimed to build an easy-to-use predictive nomogram to predict and intervene against delayed care-seeking among international migrant workers with imported malaria.Methods A prediction model was built based on cases with imported malaria from 2012 to 2019, in Jiangsu Province, China. Routine surveillance information (e.g. sex, age, symptoms, origin country and length of stay abroad), data on the place of initial care-seeking and the gross domestic product (GDP) of the destination city were extracted. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors and a nomogram was established to predict the risk of delayed care-seeking. The discrimination and calibration of the nomogram was performed using area under the curve and calibration plots. In addition, four machine learning models were used to make a comparison.Results Of 2255 patients with imported malaria, 636 (28.2%) sought care within 24 h after symptom onset, and 577 (25.6%) sought care 3 days after symptom onset. Development of symptoms before entry into China, initial care-seeking from superior healthcare facilities and a higher GDP level of the destination city were significantly associated with delayed care-seeking among migrant workers with imported malaria. Based on these independent risk factors, an easy-to-use and intuitive nomogram was established. The calibration curves of the nomogram showed good consistency.Conclusions The tool provides public health practitioners with a method for the early detection of delayed care-seeking risk among international migrant workers with imported malaria, which may be of significance in improving post-travel healthcare for labour migrants, reducing the risk of severe malaria, preventing malaria reintroduction and sustaining achievements in malaria elimination.",COUNTERFEIT,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [72374178]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71904165]; Open Project Program of Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Zoonosis [R2208]; Open Project Program of International Research Laboratory of Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonotic Diseases of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions [01]; Open Project Program of National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Parasitic Disease Control and Prevention Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory on Parasite and Vector Control Technology [wk023-007]; Jiangsu Provincial Health Commission [H2023004, X202315]",Delayed care-seeking in international migrant workers with imported malaria in China,NO

It is estimated to affect 150 million people worldwide, with a high relevance in resource-poor settings of the African continent. The gold-standard diagnosis is still direct observation of Schistosoma haematobium eggs in urine samples by optical microscopy. Novel diagnostic techniques based on digital image analysis by Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are a suitable alternative for schistosomiasis diagnosis.Methodology Digital images of 24 urine sediment samples were acquired in non-endemic settings. S. haematobium eggs were manually labeled in digital images by laboratory professionals and used for training YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models, which would achieve automatic detection and localization of the eggs. Urine sediment images were also employed to perform binary classification of images to detect erythrocytes/leukocytes with the MobileNetv3Large, EfficientNetv2, and NasNetLarge models. A robotized microscope system was employed to automatically move the slide through the X-Y axis and to auto-focus the sample.Results A total number of 1189 labels were annotated in 1017 digital images from urine sediment samples.

Here, we develop statistical models to predict hotspots at baseline prior to treatment comparing three common hotspot definitions, using epidemiologic, survey-based, and remote sensing data.

CL is difficult to diagnose because conventional methods are time-consuming, expensive, and low-sensitive. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) with machine learning (ML) algorithms has been explored as an alternative to achieve fast and accurate results for many disease diagnoses. Besides the high accuracy demonstrated in numerous studies, the spectral variations between infected and noninfected groups are too subtle to be noticed. Since variability in sample set characteristics (such as sex, age, and diet) often leads to significant data variance and limits the comprehensive understanding of spectral characteristics and immune responses, we investigate a novel methodology for diagnosing CL in an animal model study. Blood serum, skin lesions, and draining popliteal lymph node samples were collected from Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis-infected BALB/C mice under experimental conditions. The FTIR method and ML algorithms accurately differentiated between infected (CL group) and noninfected (control group) samples. The best overall accuracy (similar to 72%) was obtained in an external validation test using principal component analysis and support vector machine algorithms in the 1800-700 cm(-1) range for blood serum samples. The accuracy achieved in analyzing skin lesions and popliteal lymph node samples was satisfactory; however, notable disparities emerged in the validation tests compared to results obtained from blood samples.

Improved diagnostic methods, especially for light intensity infections, are needed for efficient, control and elimination of STHs as a public health problem, as well as STH management. Image-based artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise for STH detection in digitized stool samples. However, the diagnostic accuracy of AI-based analysis of entire microscope slides, so called whole-slide images (WSI), has previously not been evaluated on a sample-level in primary healthcare settings in STH endemic countries.Methodology/Principal findings Stool samples (n = 1,335) were collected during 2020 from children attending primary schools in Kwale County, Kenya, prepared according to the Kato-Katz method at a local primary healthcare laboratory and digitized with a portable whole-slide microscopy scanner and uploaded via mobile networks to a cloud environment. The digital samples of adequate quality (n = 1,180) were split into a training (n = 388) and test set (n = 792) and a deep-learning system (DLS) developed for detection of STHs. The DLS findings were compared with expert manual microscopy and additional visual assessment of the digital samples in slides with discordant results between the methods. Manual microscopy detected 15 (1.9%) Ascaris lumbricoides, 172 (21.7%) Tricuris trichiura and 140 (17.7%) hookworm (Ancylostoma duodenale or Necator americanus) infections in the test set. Importantly, more than 90% of all STH positive cases represented light intensity infections. With manual microscopy as the reference standard, the sensitivity of the DLS as the index test for detection of A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura and hookworm was 80%, 92% and 76%, respectively. The corresponding specificity was 98%, 90% and 95%. Notably, in 79 samples (10%) classified as negative by manual microscopy for a specific species, STH eggs were detected by the DLS and confirmed correct by visual inspection of the digital samples.Conclusions/Significance Analysis of digitally scanned stool samples with the DLS provided high diagnostic accuracy for detection of STHs. Importantly, a substantial number of light intensity infections were missed by manual microscopy but detected by the DLS. Thus, analysis of WSIs with image-based AI may provide a future tool for improved detection of STHs in a primary healthcare setting, which in turn could facilitate monitoring and evaluation of control programs. In this school survey conducted within a primary healthcare setting in rural Kenya, a deep-learning system (DLS) was developed for detection of eggs secreted in human stool from intestinal worms, so called soil-transmitted helminths (STHs). Infections caused by STHs are the most common neglected tropical diseases and a major cause of health impairment in low- and middle-income countries. Novel diagnostic methods are needed to improve disease control. In the current study, stool samples were collected from children attending local primary schools and digitized using a portable slide scanner and uploaded via mobile networks to a cloud repository. Using the digital samples, a DLS was trained and tested for the detection of eggs of the most common STHs (Ascaris lumbricoides, Tricuris trichiura and hookworms) and compared to conventional manual microscopy analysis of the samples. The results showed that the DLS was able to accurately detect STHs in the digital samples. Although the DLS detected some false positive parasites, it was able to detect a significant number of parasites that had been missed with conventional microscopy analysis. The study concludes that digital microscopy, supported by image-based artificial intelligence, can be implemented in a primary health care setting and may provide a future tool for improved STH detection and, thereby, better monitoring and evaluation of control programs.

The patients had confirmed diagnoses of either malaria, dengue fever, influenza, bacterial respiratory tract infection, or bacterial gastroenteritis, representing the most common etiologies. We used multivariate and machine learning methods to identify combinations of proteins that contributed to distinguishing infected patients from healthy controls, and each other. Malaria displayed the most unique protein signature, indicating a strong immunoregulatory response with high levels of IL10, sTNFRI and II, and sCD25 but low levels of sCD40L. In contrast, bacterial gastroenteritis had high levels of sCD40L, APRIL, and IFN-gamma, while dengue was the only infection with elevated IFN-alpha 2. These results suggest that characterization of the inflammatory profile of individuals with fever can help to identify disease-specific host responses, which in turn can be used to guide future research on diagnostic strategies and therapeutic interventions. image",C-REACTIVE PROTEIN; TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; FEBRILE ILLNESS; RECEPTORS; RECOGNITION; PARASITEMIA; MULTICENTER; CORRELATE; MALARIA; MARKERS,"Magnus Bergvall Foundation [2018-02656]; Tore Nilsson Foundation [2018-00608]; Swedish Society of Medicine [SLS-934363]; Ake Wiberg Foundation [M18-0076]; Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation [20220566]; Swedish Research Council [2019-01034, 2021-03706, 2023-01943]; Tornspiran foundation; Region Stockholm [20180120]; Stockholm County Council; Karolinska Institutet [2019-01940]; [20190478]; Swedish Research Council [2021-03706, 2019-01940, 2018-00608, 2019-01034] Funding Source: Swedish Research Council; Vinnova [2019-01940] Funding Source: Vinnova",Disease-specific plasma protein profiles in patients with fever after traveling to tropical areas,YES

To fill this gap, modeling the environment at a fine resolution brings a significant value, if combined with population-based studies. This is particularly challenging in regions where the availability of both population and environmental data are limited. In low- and middle-income countries, many demographic and health data are from nationally representative household surveys, which now provide approximate geolocations of the sampled households. In parallel, freely available remote sensing data, due to their high spatial and temporal resolution, make it possible to capture the local environment at any time. This study aims to correlate standard demographic and health information with a high-resolution environment characterization derived from satellite data, encompassing both rural and urban areas in Sub-Saharan Africa. We use the malaria indicator survey conducted in 2017-2018 in Burkina Faso. We first present a deep semisupervised domain adaptation strategy based on the intertropical climatic characteristics of the country for precisely mapping local climate zones (LCZs). This strategy models seasonal variations through contrastive learning to extract useful information for the mapping process. We then use this high-resolution LCZ map to characterize, in four groups, the immediate environment of the sampled households. We find a significant association between these local environments and malaria among households' children. Going beyond the traditional dichotomous urban/rural characterization, our results provide interesting insights for public health.

Microscopic examination of blood samples can detect and differentiate parasite species, but it is time consuming and requires expert microscopists, a resource that is not always available. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) can assist in the diagnosis of this disease by automatically detecting and differentiating microfilariae. In line with the target product profile for lymphatic filariasis as defined by the World Health Organization, we developed an edge AI system running on a smartphone whose camera is aligned with the ocular of an optical microscope that detects and differentiates filarias species in real time without the internet connection. Our object detection algorithm that uses the Single-Shot Detection (SSD) MobileNet V2 detection model was developed with 115 cases, 85 cases with 1903 fields of view and 3342 labels for model training, and 30 cases with 484 fields of view and 873 labels for model validation before clinical validation, is able to detect microfilarias at 10x magnification and distinguishes four species of them at 40x magnification: Loa loa, Mansonella perstans, Wuchereria bancrofti, and Brugia malayi. We validated our augmented microscopy system in the clinical environment by replicating the diagnostic workflow encompassed examinations at 10x and 40x with the assistance of the AI models analyzing 18 samples with the AI running on a middle range smartphone.

This innovative solution has the potential to support filariasis diagnosis and monitoring, particularly in resource-limited settings where access to expert technicians and laboratory equipment is scarce. Filariasis is a common tropical infectious disease. Depending on the parasite, it causes lymphoedema, elephantiasis, itching, blindness, etc. It is estimated that more than 1 billion people require preventive chemotherapy to stop the spread of this infection.

This disease is not only infectious among humans, but among animals as well. Malaria causes mild symptoms like fever, headache, sweating and vomiting, and muscle discomfort; severe symptoms include coma, seizures, and kidney failure. The timely identification of malaria parasites is a challenging and chaotic endeavor for health staff. An expert technician examines the schematic blood smears of infected red blood cells through a microscope. The conventional methods for identifying malaria are not efficient. Machine learning approaches are effective for simple classification challenges but not for complex tasks. Furthermore, machine learning involves rigorous feature engineering to train the model and detect patterns in the features. On the other hand, deep learning works well with complex tasks and automatically extracts low and high-level features from the images to detect disease. In this paper, EfficientNet, a deep learning-based approach for detecting Malaria, is proposed that uses red blood cell images. Experiments are carried out and performance comparison is made with pre-trained deep learning models.

Microscopic examination of blood cells remains one of the most accurate methods for malaria diagnosis, but it is time-consuming and can produce inaccurate results occasionally. Due to machine learning and deep learning advances in medical diagnosis, improved diagnostic accuracy can now be achieved while costs can be reduced compared to conventional microscopy methods. This work utilizes an open-source dataset with 26 161 blood smear images in RGB for malaria detection. Our preprocessing resized the original dimensions of the images into 64 x 64 due to the limitations in computational complexity in developing embedded systems-based malaria detection. We present a novel embedded system approach using 119 154 trainable parameters in a lightweight 17-layer SqueezeNet model for the automatic detection of malaria. Incredibly, the model is only 1.72 MB in size. An evaluation of the model's performance on the original NIH malaria dataset shows that it has exceptional accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores of 96.37%, 95.67%, 97.21%, and 96.44%, respectively. Based on a modified dataset, the results improved further to 99.71% across all metrics. Compared to current deep learning models, our model significantly outperforms them for malaria detection, making it ideal for embedded systems. This model has also been rigorously tested on the Jetson Nano B01 edge device, demonstrating a rapid single image prediction time of only 0.24 s.

Zika virus belongs to the Flavivirus genus and is primarily transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Prevention of Zika virus infection involves avoiding mosquito bites by using repellent, wearing protective clothing, and staying in screened areas, especially for pregnant women. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms with rest, fluids, and acetaminophen, with close monitoring for pregnant women. Currently, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for the Zika virus, highlighting the importance of prevention strategies to control its spread. Therefore, in this study, the Zika virus non-structural protein NS3 was targeted to inhibit Zika infection by identifying the novel inhibitor through an in silico approach. Here, 2864 natural compounds were screened using a machine learning-based QSAR model, and later docking was performed to select the potential target. Subsequently, Tanimoto similarity and clustering were performed to obtain the potential target. The three most potential compounds were obtained: (a) 5297, (b) 432449, and (c) 85137543. The protein-ligand complex's stability and flexibility were then investigated by dynamic modelling. The 300 ns simulation showed that 5297 exhibited the steadiest deviation and constant creation of hydrogen bonds.

Different routes have large effects on viral ecology, and likelihood and rate of transmission; for example, respiratory and vector-borne viruses together encompass the majority of rapid outbreaks and high-consequence animal and plant epidemics. However, determining the specific transmission route(s) can take months to years, delaying mitigation efforts. Here, we identify the vial features and evolutionary signatures which are predictive of viral transmission routes and use them to predict potential routes for fully-sequenced viruses in silico and rapidly, for both viruses with no observed routes, as well as viruses with missing routes. This was achieved by compiling a dataset of 24,953 virus-host associations with 81 defined transmission routes, constructing a hierarchy of virus transmission encompassing those routes and 42 higher-order modes, and engineering 446 predictive features from three complementary perspectives. We integrated those data and features to train 98 independent ensembles of LightGBM classifiers. We found that all features contributed to the prediction for at least one of the routes and/or modes of transmission, demonstrating the utility of our broad multi-perspective approach. Our framework achieved ROC-AUC = 0.991, and F1-score = 0.855 across all included transmission routes and modes, and was able to achieve high levels of predictive performance for high-consequence respiratory (ROC-AUC = 0.990, and F1-score = 0.864) and vector-borne transmission (ROC-AUC = 0.997, and F1-score = 0.921). Our framework ranks the viral features in order of their contribution to prediction, per transmission route, and hence identifies the genomic evolutionary signatures associated with each route. Together with the more matured field of viral host-range prediction, our predictive framework could: provide early insights into the potential for, and pattern of viral spread; facilitate rapid response with appropriate measures; and significantly triage the time-consuming investigations to confirm the likely routes of transmission. Routes of virus transmission-the mechanism(s) by which a virus physically gets from an infected to an uninfected host, are crucial to understanding how viral diseases spread among animals and plants. Here, we uncover the evolutionary signatures which can predict the transmission routes a virus uses to move from one host to another, enabling us to identify any unobserved routes for known viruses and even predict potential routes of newly emerged viruses. We first compile a comprehensive dataset of virus-host associations. Using this dataset, we employ a multi-perspective machine learning approach to achieve high predictive performance. Our framework ranks viral features by their significance in prediction, revealing genomic evolutionary signatures linked to each route. Our approach could provide early insights into viral spread patterns, facilitating prompt response efforts to new outbreaks and epidemics, and streamline laboratory investigations.

Using a cutoff derived from Youden's index (5.4 ng/mL) and an estimated prevalence of severe dengue (16.5%) in our healthcare institution, the sensitivity was 71.4% with a specificity of 87.9% in the febrile phase, and the positive and negative predictive values were 54.7% and 95.8%, respectively. Olfactomedin 4 was elevated in dengue patients but not in proportion to disease severity in the febrile phase (P = .04) There were no significant differences in chymase and tryptase levels between dengue patients and controls.Conclusions.

Without efficacious antiviral medications, vector control remains the primary strategy for battling dengue, while the recently introduced tetravalent immunization is being evaluated. The most significant and dangerous risk increasing recently is vector-borne illnesses. These illnesses induce significant human sickness and are transmitted by blood-feeding arthropods such as fleas, parasites, and mosquitos. A thorough grasp of various factors is necessary to improve prediction accuracy and typically generate inaccurate and unstable predictions, as well as machine learning (ML) models, weather-driven mechanisms, and numerical time series. OBJECTIVE: In this research, we propose a novel method for forecasting vector-borne disease risk using Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs) and the Darts Game Optimizer (DGO) algorithm. METHODS: The proposed approach entails training the RBFNs with historical disease data and enhancing their parameters with the DGO algorithm. To prepare the RBFNs, we used a massive dataset of vector-borne disease incidences, climate variables, and geographical data. The DGO algorithm proficiently searches the RBFN parameter space, fine-tuning the model's architecture to increase forecast accuracy. RESULTS: RBFN-DGO provides a potential method for predicting vector-borne disease risk. This study advances predictive demonstrating in public health by shedding light on effectively controlling vector-borne diseases to protect human populations. We conducted extensive testing to evaluate the performance of the proposed method to standard optimization methods and alternative forecasting methods. CONCLUSION: According to the findings, the RBFN-DGO model beats others in terms of accuracy and robustness in predicting the likelihood of vector-borne illness occurrences.",,,Forecasting deep learning-based risk assessment of vector-borne diseases using hybrid methodology,YES

However, yields of ACF have been lower than expected, raising concerns on its effectiveness in the programmatic setting. Distribution of TB in communities is likely to be spatially heterogeneous and targeting of ACF in areas with higher TB prevalence may help improve yields. The primary aim of SPOT-TB is to investigate whether a policy change to use a geographically targeted approach towards ACF supported by an artificial intelligence (AI) software, MATCH-AI, can improve yields in Pakistan.Methods and analysis SPOT-TB will use a pragmatic, stepped wedge cluster randomised design. A total of 30 mobile X-ray units and their field teams will be randomised to receive the intervention. Site selection for ACF in the intervention areas will be guided primarily through the use of MATCH-AI software that models subdistrict TB prevalence and identifies potential disease hotspots. Control areas will use existing approaches towards site selection that are based on staff knowledge, experience and analysis of historical data. The primary outcome measure is the difference in bacteriologically confirmed incident TB detected in the intervention relative to control areas.

While praziquantel, a widely used anti-schistosome drug, has a low cost and a high cure rate, it has several drawbacks. These include ineffectiveness against schistosome larvae, reduced efficacy in young children, and emerging drug resistance. Discovering new and active anti-schistosome small molecules is therefore critical, but this process presents the challenge of low accuracy in computer-aided methods. To address this issue, we proposed GNN-DDAS, a novel deep learning framework based on graph neural networks (GNN), designed for drug discovery to identify active anti-schistosome (DDAS) small molecules. Initially, a multi-layer perceptron was used to derive sequence features from various representations of small molecule SMILES. Next, GNN was employed to extract structural features from molecular graphs. Finally, the extracted sequence and structural features were then concatenated and fed into a fully connected network to predict active anti-schistosome small molecules. Experimental results showed that GNN-DDAS exhibited superior performance compared to the benchmark methods on both benchmark and real-world application datasets.

In 2020, nearly half of the world's population faced the risk of malaria, underscoring the urgency of innovative strategies to tackle this pervasive threat. One of the major challenges lies in the emergence of the resistance of parasites to existing antimalarial drugs. This challenge necessitates the discovery of new, effective treatments capable of combating the Plasmodium parasite at various stages of its life cycle. Advanced computational approaches have been utilized to accelerate drug development, playing a crucial role in every stage of the drug discovery and development process. We have witnessed impressive and groundbreaking achievements, with GNNs applied to graph data and BERT from transformers across diverse NLP text analysis tasks. In this study, to facilitate a more efficient and effective approach, we proposed the integration of an NLP based model for SMILES (i.e., BERT) and a GNN model (i.e., RGCN) to predict the effect of antimalarial drugs against Plasmodium. The GNN model was trained using designed antimalarial drug and potential target (i.e., PfAcAS, F/GGPPS, and PfMAGL) graph-structured data with nodes representing antimalarial drugs and potential targets, and edges representing relationships between them. The performance of BERT-RGCN was further compared with that of Mordred-RGCN to evaluate its effectiveness. The BERT-RGCN and Mordred-RGCN models performed consistently well across different feature combinations, showcasing high accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, MCC, AUROC, and AUPRC values.

Despite its popularity, docking accuracy is often limited due to the trade-off between speed and precision required for screening large compound libraries. In the present work, we leverage graph convolutional networks (GCNs), a state-of-the-art deep neural network architecture, to enhance docking capacity for prioritizing active compounds from a library of similar to 200,000 compounds screened against Cruzain. We propose strategies to integrate both techniques into a single VS pipeline. By applying the GCN as a pre-docking filter, the compound library was enriched with active molecules, resulting in higher hit rates in subsequent docking screenings. Additionally, to further enhance the docking performance, the GCN-learned atomic embeddings were directly incorporated into the docking process through pharmacophoric restraints. Unlike common approaches that use deep learning (DL) scoring functions to rank pre-generated docking poses, the approaches we propose here have the advantage that only compounds that passed the DL filters need to be screened by the more computationally demanding docking method.

The results were next verified by analysis of inter-group differences and ROC curve analysis. Next, immune-related function and immune cell correlation analyses were performed, and plaques of human ACAS were applied to verify the results via immunohistochemistry (IH) and immunofluorescence (IF). Finally, the competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) and transcription factors (TFs) regulatory networks of the characterized genes were constructed.Results: A total of 177 differentially expressed genes were identified, including 67 genes downregulated and 110 genes upregulated. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that five pathways were active in the experimental group, including xenograft rejection, autoimmune thyroid disease, graft-versus-host disease, leishmaniasis infection, and lysosomes.

It is an infectious disease caused by a Plasmodium spp. parasite and transmitted by the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito. The parasite multiplies in the liver and then destroys the person's red blood cells until it reaches the severe stage, leading to death. The most used tools for diagnosing this disease are the microscope and the rapid diagnostic test (RDT), which have limitations preventing control of the disease. Computer vision technologies present alternatives by providing the means for early detection of this disease before it reaches the severe stage, facilitating treatment and saving patients. In this article, we suggest deep learning methods for earlier and more accurate detection of malaria parasites with high generalization capabilities using microscopic images of blood smears from many heterogeneous patients. These techniques are based on an image preprocessing method that mitigates some of the challenges associated with the variety of red cell characteristics due to patient diversity and other artifacts present in the data. For the study, we collected 65,970 microscopic images from 876 different patients to form a dataset of 33,007 images with a variety that enables us to create models with a high level of generalization.

Phlebotominae sand flies are the vectors of leishmaniasis. Their density is known to be influenced by context-specific climatic and land use patterns. Thus, we aimed to investigate how these factors drive sand fly density across Sri Lanka.Methodology/Principal findings We analysed monthly collections of sand flies (n = 38,594) and weather data from ten sentinel sites representing three main geo-climatic zones across Sri Lanka, over 24 months. Site-specific land use data was also recorded. The influence of climate and land use patterns on sand fly density across the sentinel sites were estimated using distributed lag non-linear models and machine learning. We found that climate played a major role on sand fly density compared to land use structure. Increase in rainfall and relative humidity at real time, and ambient temperature and soil temperature with a 2-month lag were associated with a statistically significant increase in sand fly density. The maximum relative risk (RR) observed was 3.76 (95% CI: 1.58-8.96) for rainfall at 120 mm/month, 2.14 (95% CI: 1.04-4.38) for relative humidity at 82% (both at real time). The maximum RR was 2.81 (95% CI: 1.09-7.35) for ambient temperature at 34.5 degrees C, and 11.6 (95% CI, 4.38-30.76) for soil temperature (both at a 2-month lag). The real-time increase in ambient temperature, sunshine hours, and evaporation rate, however, reduced sand fly density homogeneously in all study settings. The high density of chena and coconut plantations, together with low density of dense forests, homesteads, and low human footprint values, positively influenced sand fly density.Conclusions/Significance The findings improve our understanding of the dynamic influence of environment on sand fly densities and spread of leishmaniasis.

Several methods for predicting the occurrence of dengue fever in Taiwan have been proposed. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the relationship between air quality indices (AQIs) and dengue fever in Taiwan. Results This study aimed to develop a dengue fever prediction model in which meteorological factors, a vector index, and AQIs were incorporated into different machine learning algorithms. A total of 805 meteorological records from 2013 to 2015 were collected from government open-source data after preprocessing. In addition to well-known dengue-related factors, we investigated the effects of novel variables, including particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < 10 m (PM10), PM2.5, and an ultraviolet index, for predicting dengue fever occurrence. The collected dataset was randomly divided into an 80% training set and a 20% test set. The experimental results showed that the random forests achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9547 for the test set, which was the best compared with the other machine learning algorithms. In addition, the temperature was the most important factor in our variable importance analysis, and it showed a positive effect on dengue fever at < 30 degrees C but had less of an effect at > 30 degrees C.

This study focuses on developing climate-based machine learning models to forecast dengue outbreaks in Ba Ria Vung Tau (BRVT) province, Vietnam, using meteorological data from 2003 to 2022. We utilized four predictive models-Negative Binomial Regression (NBR), Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors (SARIMAX), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) v2.0.3, and long short-term memory (LSTM)-to predict weekly dengue incidence. Key climate variables, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed, were integrated into these models, with lagged variables included to capture delayed climatic effects on dengue transmission. The NBR model demonstrated the best performance in terms of predictive accuracy, achieving the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE), compared to other models. The inclusion of lagged climate variables significantly enhanced the model's ability to predict dengue cases. Although effective in capturing seasonal trends, SARIMAX and LSTM models struggled with overfitting and failed to accurately predict short-term outbreaks.

The sample comprised 2,006 patients, divided into 75% for training and 25% for testing algorithm performance. We evaluated the model performance using precision, recall, and AUC-ROC metrics.Results The Adaboost algorithm yielded an AUC-ROC of 0.772, a precision of 0.199, and a recall of 0.612. We simulated the decision boundary using various thresholds and observed that in this dataset a threshold of 0.45 resulted in a 100% recall. This finding suggests that employing such a threshold could potentially save 22.5% of the cost associated with mass testing of Chagas disease.Conclusion Our findings highlight the potential of applying machine learning to improve the sensitivity and effectiveness of Chagas disease diagnosis and prevention. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of integrating socio-demographic and environmental factors into neglected disease prediction models to enhance their performance. Chagas disease, a severe parasitic illness prevalent in Latin America, poses significant challenges due to delayed detection and treatment. Machine learning algorithms, advanced computer programs, have emerged as valuable tools for disease prediction and diagnosis. In our study, we utilized these algorithms to forecast Chagas disease risk based on factors such as age, gender, and living conditions. Drawing on data from the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study (REDS), we trained five algorithms, with one showing promising results, achieving an impressive score of 0.772 out of 1. By establishing a specific threshold, we could potentially reduce testing costs while maintaining high detection rates. This research highlights the potential of machine learning in improving Chagas disease diagnosis and prevention by incorporating socio-demographic and environmental factors. Integrating these elements into predictive models has the potential to enhance their effectiveness and sensitivity, thereby improving disease management outcomes and ultimately reducing the burden of Chagas disease in affected regions.",,,Machine learning for predicting Chagas disease infection in rural areas of Brazil,YES

We compared Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) with Logistic Regression (LR) for their ability to estimate the probability of rabies in animals investigated as part of an Integrated Bite Case Management program (IBCM). To balance our training data, we used Random Oversampling (ROS) and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique. We developed a risk stratification framework based on predicted rabies probabilities. XGB performed better at predicting rabies cases than LR. Oversampling strategies enhanced the model sensitivity making them the preferred technique to predict rare events like rabies in a biting animal. XGB-ROS classified most of the confirmed rabies cases and only a small proportion of non-cases as either high (confirmed cases = 85.2%, non-cases = 0.01%) or moderate (confirmed cases = 8.4%, non-cases = 4.0%) risk.

2024.0,prognosis,,"Background: Blood component transfusions are a common and often necessary medical practice during the epidemics of dengue. Transfusions are required for patients when they developed severe dengue fever or thrombocytopenia of 10 109 pound/L or less. This study therefore investigated the risk factors, performance and effectiveness of eight different machine-learning algorithms to predict blood component transfusion requirements in confirmed dengue cases admitted to hospital. The objective was to study the risk factors that can help to predict blood component transfusion needs. Methods: Eight predictive models were developed based on retrospective data from a private group of hospitals in India. A python package SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to explain the output of the XGBoost model. Results: Sixteen vital variables were finally selected as having the most significant effects on blood component transfusion prediction. The XGBoost model presented significantly better predictive performance (area under the curve: 0.793; 95 % confidence interval: 0.699-0.795) than the other models. Conclusion: Predictive modelling techniques can be utilized to streamline blood component preparation procedures and can help in the triage of high-risk patients and readiness of caregivers to provide blood component transfusions when required. This study demonstrates the potential of multilayer algorithms to reasonably predict any blood component transfusion needs which may help healthcare providers make more informed decisions regarding patient care.

While machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods have shown promise in accelerating antimalarial drug discovery, the performance of deep learning models based on molecular graph and other co-representation approaches warrants further exploration. Current research has overlooked mutant strains of the malaria parasite with varying degrees of sensitivity or resistance, and has not covered the prediction of inhibitory activities across the three major life cycle stages (liver, asexual blood, and gametocyte) within the human host, which is crucial for both treatment and transmission blocking. In this study, we manually curated a benchmark antimalarial activity dataset comprising 407,404 unique compounds and 410,654 bioactivity data points across ten Plasmodium phenotypes and three stages. The performance was systematically compared among two fingerprint-based ML models (RF::Morgan and XGBoost: Morgan), four graph-based DL models (GCN, GAT, MPNN, and Attentive FP), and three co-representations DL models (FP-GNN, HiGNN, and FG-BERT), which reveal that: 1) The FP-GNN model achieved the best predictive performance, outperforming the other methods in distinguishing active and inactive compounds across balanced, more positive, and more negative datasets, with an overall AUROC of 0.900; 2) Fingerprint-based ML models outperformed graph-based DL models on large datasets (>1000 compounds), but the three co-representations DL models were able to incorporate domain-specific chemical knowledge to bridge this gap, achieving better predictive performance. These findings provide valuable guidance for selecting appropriate ML and DL methods for antimalarial activity prediction tasks. The interpretability analysis of the FP-GNN model revealed its ability to accurately capture the key structural features responsible for the liver- and blood-stage activities of the known antimalarial drug atovaquone.

Artificial Intelligence could improve the management of febrile travellers.Methods Data from a multicentric prospective study of febrile travellers were obtained to build a machine-learning model to predict malaria cases among travellers presenting with fever. Demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory variables were leveraged as features. Eleven machine-learning classification models were evaluated by 50-fold cross-validation in a Training set. Then, the model with the best performance, defined by the Area Under the Curve (AUC), was chosen for parameter optimization and evaluation in the Test set. Finally, a reduced model was elaborated with those features that contributed most to the model.Results Out of 11 machine-learning models, XGBoost presented the best performance (mean AUC of 0.98 and a mean F1 score of 0.78).

Hence, the present study used a metabolomic approach integrated with machine models to identify differentially expressed metabolites in patients with SD compared to nonsevere patients and healthy controls.MethodsComprehensively, the plasma was collected at different clinical phases during dengue without warning signs (DWOW, N = 10), dengue with warning signs (DWW, N = 10), and SD (N = 10) at different stages [i.e., day of admission (DOA), day of defervescence (DOD), and day of convalescent (DOC)] in comparison to healthy control (HC). The samples were subjected to LC-ESI-MS/MS to identify metabolites. Statistical and machine learning analyses were performed using R and Python language. Further, biomarker, pathway and correlation analysis was performed to identify potential predictors of dengue.Results & conclusionA total of 423 metabolites were identified in all the study groups. Paired and unpaired t-tests revealed 14 highly differentially expressed metabolites between and across the dengue groups, with four metabolites (shikimic acid, ureidosuccinic acid, propionyl carnitine, and alpha-tocopherol) showing significant differences compared to HC. Furthermore, biomarker (ROC) analysis revealed 11 potential molecules with a significant AUC value of 1 that could serve as potential biomarkers for identifying different dengue clinical stages that are beneficial for predicting dengue disease outcomes. The logistic regression model revealed that S-adenosylhomocysteine, hypotaurine, and shikimic acid metabolites could be beneficial indicators for predicting severe dengue, with an accuracy and AUC of 0.75. The data showed that dengue infection is related to lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, metabolomic adaptation, and virus manipulation. Moreover, the biomarkers had a significant correlation with biochemical parameters like platelet count, and hematocrit.

More than 60% of KA cases originate in South Asia, wherein India accounts for 2/3rd of the cases, and Bihar, a state in India, alone accounts for more than 50% of the Indian cases. Past studies suspected climate change vulnerabilities as a driving cause of KA outbreaks. The VBDs-based epidemic prediction systems have been developed to mitigate recurrent outbreaks; however, Machine Learning (ML) based approaches still need to be explored for modeling changing climate impacts on KA cases. This study, for the first time, develops a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel-based Support Vector Regression (SVR), hereinafter RBF-kernel-based-SVR model for the most-affected endemic districts of Bihar (northern-India), using the data from 2016 and 2021. Forward selection, backward elimination, and stepwise regression procedures were adopted while selecting influential climatic variables, followed by the k-fold cross-validation technique and, then, the RBF-kernel-based-SVR algorithm for classification. Results suggested that temperature, wind speed, rainfall, and population density significantly contributed to the KA outbreaks.

2024.0,diagnosis,Zhejiang Sci-Tech University,"Malaria is one of the major global health threats. Microscopic examination has been designated as the gold standard for malaria detection by the World Health Organization. However, it heavily relies on the experience of doctors, resulting in long diagnosis time, low efficiency, and a high risk of missed or misdiagnosed cases. To alleviate the pressure on healthcare workers and achieve automated malaria detection, numerous target detection models have been applied to the blood smear examination for malaria cells. This paper introduces the multi-level attention split network (MAS-Net) that improves the overall detection performance by addressing the issues of information loss for small targets and mismatch between the detection receptive field and target size. Therefore, we propose the split contextual attention structure (SPCot), which fully utilizes contextual information and avoids excessive channel compression operations, reducing information loss and improving the overall detection performance of malaria cells. In the shallow detection layer, we introduce the multi-scale receptive field detection head (MRFH), which better matches targets of different scales and provides a better detection receptive field, thus enhancing the performance of malaria cell detection. On the NLM-Malaria Dataset provided by the National Institutes of Health, the improved model achieves an average accuracy of 75.9% in the public dataset of Plasmodium vivax (malaria)-infected human blood smear.

The co-existence of these pathogens in overlapping regions complicates effective disease control strategies. This study aimed to clarify the distribution and interaction of these diseases within Southeast Asia. Methods We systematically collated occurrence records of human clonorchiasis (n = 1809) and opisthorchiasis (n = 731) across the Southeast Asia countries. Utilizing species distribution models incorporating environmental and climatic data, coupled machine learning algorithms with boosted regression trees, we predicted and distinguished endemic areas for each fluke species. Machine learning techniques, including geospatial analysis, were employed to delineate the boundaries between these flukes. Results Our analysis revealed that the endemic range of C. sinensis and O. viverrini in Southeast Asia primarily spans across part of China, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. During the period from 2000 to 2018, we identified C. sinensis infections in 84 distinct locations, predominantly in southern China (Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region) and northern Vietnam. In a stark contrast, O. viverrini was more widely distributed, with infections documented in 721 locations across Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Critical environmental determinants were quantitatively analyzed, revealing annual mean temperatures ranging between 14 and 20 C-degrees in clonorchiasis-endemic areas and 24-30 C-degrees in opisthorchiasis regions (P < 0.05). The machine learning model effectively mapped a distinct demarcation zone, demonstrating a clear separation between the endemic areas of these two liver flukes with AUC from 0.9 to1. The study in Vietnam delineates the coexistence and geographical boundaries of C. sinensis and O. viverrini, revealing distinct endemic zones and a transitional area where both liver fluke species overlap.

One optimal candidate gene was selected through LASSO regression and SVM: CCL2. The ROC curve confirmed the presence of CCL2 in both the NAFLD and UC training sets and other validation sets. This finding was further validated using a nomogram in the validation set. Additionally, the expression levels of CCL2 for NAFLD and UC showed a significant correlation with immune cell infiltration.Conclusion This study identified a gene (CCL2) as a biomarker for NAFLD and UC, which may actively participate in the progression of NAFLD and UC.

To this end, we adopt a multi-source data-driven Random Forest approach that integrates bottomland and ground-surface texture data with traditional environmental variables, enhancing the accuracy of snail habitat assessments. We developed four distinct models for the lake and marshland areas of Guichi, China: a baseline model incorporating ground-surface texture, bottomland variables, and environmental variables; Model 1 with only environmental variables; Model 2 adding ground-surface texture and environmental variables; and Model 3 integrating bottomland with environmental variables. The baseline model outperformed the others, achieving a true skill statistic of 0.93, an accuracy of 0.97, a kappa statistic of 0.94, and an area under the curve of 0.99.

Method: Using weekly dengue case and meteorological data from 2012 to 2022, the data was preprocessed and analyzed using various machine learning algorithms, including General Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms. Performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) were employed. Results: From 2012 to 2022, there was a total of 164,333 cases of dengue fever. Singapore witnessed a fluctuating number of dengue cases, peaking notably in 2020 and revealing a strong seasonality between March and July. An analysis of meteorological data points highlighted connections between certain climate variables and dengue fever outbreaks. The correlation analyses suggested significant associations between dengue cases and specific weather factors such as solar radiation, solar energy, and UV index. For disease predictions, the XGBoost model showed the best performance with an MAE = 89.12, RMSE = 156.07, and R2 = 0.83, identifying time as the primary factor, while 19 key predictors showed non-linear associations with dengue transmission. This underscores the significant role of environmental conditions, including cloud cover and rainfall, in dengue propagation.

Implementing public health interventions in the field of epidemiology depends on efficient modeling and outbreak prediction. Because RNNs can capture sequential dependencies in data, they have become highly effective tools in this field. In this paper, the use of RNNs in epidemic modeling is examined, with a focus on the extent to which they can handle the inherent temporal dynamics in the spread of diseases. The mathematical representation of epidemics requires taking time -dependent variables into account, such as the rate at which infections spread and the long-term effects of interventions. The goal of this study is to use an intelligent computing solution based on RNNs to provide numerical performances and interpretations for the SEIR nonlinear system based on the propagation of the Zika virus (SEIRS-PZV) model. The four patient dynamics, namely susceptible patients S(y), exposed patients admitted in a hospital E(y), the fraction of infective individuals I(y), and recovered patients R(y), are represented by the epidemic version of the nonlinear system, or the SEIR model. SEIRS-PZV is represented by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which are then solved by the Adams method using the Mathematica software to generate a dataset. The dataset was used as an output for the RNN to train the model and examine results such as regressions, correlations, error histograms, etc. For RNN, we used 100% to train the model with 15 hidden layers and a delay of 2 seconds. The input for the RNN is a time series sequence from 0 to 5, with a step size of 0.05. In the end, we compared the approximated solution with the exact solution by plotting them on the same graph and generating the absolute error plot for each of the 4 cases of SEIRS-PZV. Predictions made by the model appeared to be become more accurate when the mean squared error (MSE) decreased. An increased fit to the observed data was suggested by this decrease in the MSE, which suggested that the variance between the model's predicted values and the actual values was dropping. A minimal absolute error almost equal to zero was obtained, which further supports the usefulness of the suggested strategy. A small absolute error shows the degree to which the model's predictions matches the ground truth values, thus indicating the level of accuracy and precision for the model's output.",BIOLOGY,Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University [PSAU/2024/01/78916],Recurrent neural network for the dynamics of Zika virus spreading,YES

These vectors are geographically shifting under climate and other anthropogenic changes. As small-bodied ectotherms, mosquitoes are strongly affected by temperature, which causes unimodal responses in mosquito life history traits (e.g., biting rate, adult mortality rate, mosquito development rate, and probability of egg-to-adult survival) that exhibit upper and lower thermal limits and intermediate thermal optima in laboratory studies. However, it remains unknown how mosquito thermal responses measured in laboratory experiments relate to the realized thermal responses of mosquitoes in the field. To address this gap, we leverage thousands of global mosquito occurrences and geospatial satellite data at high spatial resolution to construct machine-learning based species distribution models, from which vector thermal responses are estimated. We apply methods to restrict models to the relevant mosquito activity season and to conduct ecologically plausible spatial background sampling centered around ecoregions for comparison to mosquito occurrence records. We found that thermal minima estimated from laboratory studies were highly correlated with those from the species distributions (r = 0.87). The thermal optima were less strongly correlated (r = 0.69). For most species, we did not detect thermal maxima from their observed distributions so were unable to compare to laboratory-based estimates. The results suggest that laboratory studies have the potential to be highly transportable to predicting lower thermal limits and thermal optima of mosquitoes in the field. At the same time, lab-based models likely capture physiological limits on mosquito persistence at high temperatures that are not apparent from field-based observational studies but may critically determine mosquito responses to climate warming. Our results indicate that lab-based and field-based studies are highly complementary; performing the analyses in concert can help to more comprehensively understand vector response to climate change. Mosquito vectors are strongly affected by temperature, and their distributions are likely to shift under climate change. Lab studies show that mosquito abundance has a unimodal response to temperature with thermal optima, upper and lower thermal limits. However, it remains unknown how mosquito laboratory-derived thermal responses relate to the thermal responses of mosquitoes in nature. We used a global database of field-collected mosquito occurrences, geospatial environmental covariates, and species distribution models to estimate the relationship between temperature and probability of mosquito occurrence. We found that thermal minima (r = 0.87) and, to a lesser degree, thermal optima (r = 0.69) estimated from laboratory studies were correlated with those from the species distribution models.

This research sought to investigate the prevalence of malaria and identify potential risk factors in Edo-North, Nigeria. Additionally, the study aimed to analyze trends in malaria cases to inform the development of effective malaria control measures. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted in six local government areas of Edo-North, Nigeria, between June and August 2023. Using systematic sampling, study zones, local governments, towns, villages, and households were selected. Data on sociodemographics and environmental risk factors were collected from 605 participants through questionnaires and blood samples. Blood smears were microscopically examined, binary and multivariate logistic regression was used for data analysis. Malaria disease rate trends were also analyzed from health records. Statistical analyses were performed using R software, with p-values less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results: The overall malaria prevalence in the study area was 15.54%, with males more likely to be infected than females. Prevalence varied across localities, with Akoko-Edo having the highest rate. Children had the highest prevalence. Rural residents were more likely to have malaria than urban residents. Binary logistic regression identified several risk factors, including age, location, local government area, education, occupation, marital status, housing type, household size, water source, sanitation, surrounding environment, window net use, ceiling type, water storage, and parasite density. The multivariate logistic regression analysis identified several significant risk factors for malaria in the study population. Children, residents of Owan-East, individuals using pit latrines, and those not sleeping under LLINs were at significantly increased risk. Environmental factors such as proximity to bushes, streams/rivers, and storing water in open containers were also associated with higher malaria prevalence. History of malaria treatment at pharmacies and use of Chloroquine/Quinine medication were linked to recurrent infections. The study found a high average parasite density (5,146 parasites/mL) and low consistent LLIN use despite widespread ownership. Trend analysis from malaria records revealed a decline in malaria prevalence from 2020 to 2023. Conclusions: The study identified several demographic, environmental and behavioural factors associated with malaria risk in Edo North.

Reducing vector populations is a promising strategy for disease control, especially in the case of tsetsetransmitted African trypanosomiasis. However, the cost-effective implementation of large-scale vector surveillance and control measures face challenges due to the lack of spatially explicit and reliable maps identifying vector hotspots. In this study, we assessed the accuracy of predicting Glossina pallidipes relative densities across Kenya by linking constrained in-situ tsetse catch data from 660 traps across three Kenyan regions with readily available gridded satellite information (human population, land cover, soil properties, elevation, precipitation, and land surface temperature) using a classical random forest algorithm. To enhance predictive performance, we employed two feature elimination techniques specifically designed for machine learning algorithms, i.e., Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF). For each set of retained variables, we trained a Random Forest model using a spatial cross-validation technique. Our findings showed that tsetse fly relative densities decreased with mean annual precipitation, and soil moisture, and conversely increased with higher tree cover. Based on the cross-validated R2, 41% of the spatial variability in relative densities of tsetse flies could be explained. For spatial extrapolation, only the set of predictors retained by VSURF closely matched known tsetse fly distributions in Kenya. This more accurate performance of VSURF may be attributed to its approach of assessing variables for both importance and their contribution to reducing prediction error. Our study demonstrates the potential of using a random forest method to upscale tsetse relative abundance predictions to the national level. However, the reliability of the current extrapolated map remains uncertain.

This study explored the progress of the 2 most recent national schistosomiasis control programs in an endemic area along the Yangtze River in China. METHODS: We obtained village-level parasitological data from cross-sectional surveys combined with environmental data in Anhui Province, China from 1997 to 2015. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based on a hierarchical integro-difference equation (IDE) framework (i.e., CNN-IDE) was used to model spatio-temporal variations in schistosomiasis. Two traditional models were also constructed for comparison with 2 evaluation indicators: the mean-squared prediction error (MSPE) and continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). RESULTS: The CNN-IDE model was the optimal model, with the lowest overall average MSPE of 0.04 and the CRPS of 0.19. From 1997 to 2011, the prevalence exhibited a notable trend: it increased steadily until peaking at 1.6 per 1,000 in 2005, then gradually declined, stabilizing at a lower rate of approximately 0.6 per 1,000 in 2006, and approaching zero by 2011. During this period, noticeable geographic disparities in schistosomiasis prevalence were observed; high-risk areas were initially dispersed, followed by contraction. Predictions for the period 2012 to 2015 demonstrated a consistent and uniform decrease. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed CNN-IDE model captured the intricate and evolving dynamics of schistosomiasis prevalence, offering a promising alternative for future risk modeling of the disease.

The Zika virus (ZIKV), which is transmitted by mosquito vectors to nonhuman primates and humans, causes devastating outbreaks in the poorest tropical regions of the world. Molecular epidemiology, supported by clustering phylogenetic gold standard studies using sequence data, has provided valuable information for tracking and controlling the spread of ZIKV. Unsupervised learning (UL), a form of machine learning algorithm, can be applied on the datasets without the need of known information for training. Methods. In this work, unsupervised Random Forest (URF), followed by the application of dimensional reduction algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and autoencoders were used to uncover hidden patterns from polymorphic amino acid sites extracted on the proteome ZIKV multi-alignments, without the need of an underlying evolutionary model. Results. The four UL algorithms revealed specific host and geographical clustering patterns for ZIKV. Among the four dimensionality reduction (DR) algorithms, the performance was better for UMAP. The four algorithms allowed the identification of imported viruses for specific geographical clusters. The UL dimension coordinates showed a significant correlation with phylogenetic tree branch lengths and significant phylogenetic dependence in Abouheif's Cmean and Pagel's Lambda tests (p value < 0.01) that showed comparable performance with the phylogenetic method. This analytical strategy was generalizable to an external large dengue type 2 dataset. Conclusion.

Conventional microscopy is the standard diagnostic method in resource-limited settings, but with limitations, such as the need for expert microscopists. An automated digital microscope with artificial intelligence (Schistoscope), offers a potential solution. This field study aimed to validate the diagnostic performance of the Schistoscope for detecting and quantifying Schistosoma haematobium eggs in urine compared to conventional microscopy and to a composite reference standard (CRS) consisting of real-time PCR and the up-converting particle (UCP) lateral flow (LF) test for the detection of schistosome circulating anodic antigen (CAA). Methods Based on a non-inferiority concept, the Schistoscope was evaluated in two parts: study A, consisting of 339 freshly collected urine samples and study B, consisting of 798 fresh urine samples that were also banked as slides for analysis with the Schistoscope. In both studies, the Schistoscope, conventional microscopy, real-time PCR and UCP-LF CAA were performed and samples with all the diagnostic test results were included in the analysis. All diagnostic procedures were performed in a laboratory located in a rural area of Gabon, endemic for S. haematobium. Results In study A and B, the Schistoscope demonstrated a sensitivity of 83.1% and 96.3% compared to conventional microscopy, and 62.9% and 78.0% compared to the CRS. The sensitivity of conventional microscopy in study A and B compared to the CRS was 61.9% and 75.2%, respectively, comparable to the Schistoscope. The specificity of the Schistoscope in study A (78.8%) was significantly lower than that of conventional microscopy (96.4%) based on the CRS but comparable in study B (90.9% and 98.0%, respectively). Conclusion Overall, the performance of the Schistoscope was non-inferior to conventional microscopy with a comparable sensitivity, although the specificity varied. The Schistoscope shows promising diagnostic accuracy, particularly for samples with moderate to higher infection intensities as well as for banked sample slides, highlighting the potential for retrospective analysis in resource-limited settings.",REAL-TIME PCR; SENSITIVITY; IMPACT,NWO-WOTRO Science for Global Development program [W 07.30318.009],Validation of artificial intelligence-based digital microscopy for automated detection of Schistosoma haematobium eggs in urine in Gabon,NO

Reversing this trend and eliminating malaria worldwide requires improvements in malaria diagnosis, in which artificial intelligence (AI) has recently been demonstrated to have a great potential. One of the main reasons for the use of neural networks (NNs) is the time saving through automatising the process and the elimination of human error. When classifying with two-dimensional images of red blood cells (RBCs), the number of parameters fitted by the NN for the classification of RBCs is extremely high, which strongly influences the performance of the network, especially for training sets of moderate size. The complicated handling of malaria culturing and sample preparation does not only limit the efficiency of NNs due to small training sets, but also because of the uneven distribution of red blood cell (RBC) categories.

However, the available forecasting models (e.g., weather-driven mechanistic, statistical time series, and machine learning models) lack a clear understanding of different components to improve prediction accuracy and often provide unstable and unreliable forecasts. This study proposes an ensemble wavelet neural network with exogenous factor(s) (XEWNet) model that can produce reliable estimates for dengue outbreak prediction for three geographical regions, namely San Juan, Iquitos, and Ahmedabad. The proposed XEWNet model is flexible and can easily incorporate exogenous climate variable(s) confirmed by statistical causality tests in its scalable framework. The proposed model is an integrated approach that uses wavelet transformation into an ensemble neural network framework that helps in generating more reliable long-term forecasts. The proposed XEWNet allows complex non-linear relationships between the dengue incidence cases and rainfall; however, mathematically interpretable, fast in execution, and easily comprehensible. The proposal's competitiveness is measured using computational experiments based on various statistical metrics and several statistical comparison tests. In comparison with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning methods, our proposed XEWNet performs better in 75% of the cases for short-term and long-term forecasting of dengue incidence.",TIME-SERIES; AEDES-AEGYPTI; MODEL; DECOMPOSITION; TEMPERATURE; VECTOR,,An ensemble neural network approach to forecast Dengue outbreak based on climatic condition,YES

Microscopy is widely used for malaria diagnosis. However, it relies heavily on the skills and experience of inspectors. Due to low-level medical services and the lack of skilled inspectors, misdiagnoses are frequently made in some areas. MethodsIn recent years, many successful applications of CNN models have been reported. Unlike images in the ImageNet, the image of plasmodium only has a tiny defect area with a large amount of information. In addition, the dataset is extremely unbalanced: the number of positive samples is much less than that of negative samples. This paper proposes a classification network by combining attention mechanism and ResNeSt for plasmodium detection and using self-supervised learning to pre-train the network. First, the positive samples were adopted to pre-train the network. Then, attention modules were taken to highlight the feature area. To support current and future research, we also constructed a plasmodium dataset with Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium malaria and non-Plasmodium. Through self-supervised learning, a large amount of unlabeled data is used to mine the representational features, thus improving the feature extraction capability of the model and achieving higher accuracy, while saving the physician's labeling time and improving the classification accuracy. ResultsThe experiments show that our model exhibits an excellent performance and that the test accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity attain 97.8%, 96.5%, and 98.9%, respectively. ConclusionThe AI classification method proposed in this paper can effectively assist clinicians in the diagnosis and provide a basis for the automatic detection of malaria parasites in the future.",,,An intelligent detection method for plasmodium based on self-supervised learning and attention mechanism,YES

Using the Brazilian Amazon malaria surveillance dataset as a case study, in this paper we explore the potential for unsupervised anomaly detection machine learning techniques to discover signals of epidemiological interest. We found that our models were able to provide an early indication of outbreak onset, outbreak peaks, and change points in the proportion of positive malaria cases. Specifically, the sustained rise in malaria in the Brazilian Amazon in 2016 was flagged by several models. We found that no single model detected all anomalies across all health regions. Because of this, we provide the minimum number of machine learning models top-k models) to maximise the number of anomalies detected across different health regions. We discovered that the top three models that maximise the coverage of the number and types of anomalies detected across the thirteen health regions are principal component analysis, stochastic outlier selection, and the minimum covariance determinant.

A machine learning-based model to solve a specific medical problem is developed to achieve this research purpose. Specifically, this study presents an AI solution for malaria infection diagnosis by applying the CNN (convolutional neural network) algorithm. Based on malaria microscopy image data from the NIH National Library of Medicine, a total of 24,958 images were used for deep learning training, and 2600 images were selected for final testing of the proposed diagnostic architecture. The empirical results indicate that the CNN diagnostic model correctly classified most malaria-infected and non-infected cases with minimal misclassification, with performance metrics of precision (0.97), recall (0.99), and f1-score (0.98) for uninfected cells, and precision (0.99), recall (0.97), and f1-score (0.98) for parasite cells. The CNN diagnostic solution rapidly processed a large number of cases with a high reliable accuracy of 97.81%. The performance of this CNN model was further validated through the k-fold cross-validation test. These results suggest the advantage of machine learning-based diagnostic methods over conventional manual diagnostic methods in improving healthcare operational capabilities in terms of diagnostic quality, processing costs, lead time, and productivity. In addition, a machine learning diagnosis system is more likely to enhance the financial profitability of healthcare operations by reducing the risk of unnecessary medical disputes related to diagnostic errors.

Driven mainly by social and environmental factors, dengue incidence and geographical expansion have increased in recent decades. Therefore, understanding how climate variables drive dengue outbreaks is challenging and a problem of interest for decision-makers that could aid in improving surveillance and resource allocation. Here, we explore the effect of climate variables on relative dengue risk in 32 cantons of interest for public health authorities in Costa Rica. Relative dengue risk is forecast using a Generalized Additive Model for location, scale, and shape and a Random Forest approach.

Autokeras is able to identify the optimal neural network to perform the classification task. Hence, the robustness of the adopted model is due to it not needing any prior knowledge from deep learning.

2023.0,diagnosis,Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Mansoura University; Arab East Colleges,"Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used successfully in many fields, particularly, in medical diagnosis. However, deep learning (DL) models are expensive in terms of memory and computing resources, which hinders their implementation in limited-resources devices or for delay-sensitive systems. Therefore, these deep models need to be accelerated and compressed to smaller sizes to be deployed on edge devices without noticeably affecting their performance. In this paper, recent accelerating and compression approaches of DNN are analyzed and compared regarding their performance, applications, benefits, and limitations with a more focus on the knowledge distillation approach as a successful emergent approach in this field. In addition, a framework is proposed to develop knowledge distilled DNN models that can be deployed on fog/edge devices for automatic disease diagnosis. To evaluate the proposed framework, two compressed medical diagnosis systems are proposed based on knowledge distillation deep neural models for both COVID-19 and Malaria. The experimental results show that these knowledge distilled models have been compressed by 18.4% and 15% of the original model and their responses accelerated by 6.14x and 5.86%, respectively, while there were no significant drop in their performance (dropped by 0.9% and 1.2%, respectively).

2023.0,diagnosis,Tulane University; Tulane University,"Author summaryThe diagnosis of skin diseases depends in large part, though not exclusively on visual inspection. The diagnosis and management of these diseases is thus particularly amenable to teledermatology approaches. The widespread availability of cell phone technology and electronic information transfer provides new potential for access to health care in low-income countries, yet there are limited efforts targeting these neglected populations with dark skin and consequently limited availability of tools. In this study, we leveraged a collection of skin images gathered through a system of teledermatology in the West African countries of Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana, and applied deep learning, a form of artificial intelligence (AI)-to see if deep learning models can distinguish between different diseases and support their diagnosis. Skin-related neglected tropical diseases, or skin NTDs, prevail in these regions and were our target conditions: Buruli ulcer, leprosy, mycetoma, scabies, and yaws. The accuracy of prediction depended on the number of images that were fed into the model for training with marginal improvement using laboratory confirmed cases in training. Using more images and greater efforts in this area, it is possible that AI can help address the unmet needs where access to medical care is limited. BackgroundDeep learning, which is a part of a broader concept of artificial intelligence (AI) and/or machine learning has achieved remarkable success in vision tasks. While there is growing interest in the use of this technology in diagnostic support for skin-related neglected tropical diseases (skin NTDs), there have been limited studies in this area and fewer focused on dark skin. In this study, we aimed to develop deep learning based AI models with clinical images we collected for five skin NTDs, namely, Buruli ulcer, leprosy, mycetoma, scabies, and yaws, to understand how diagnostic accuracy can or cannot be improved using different models and training patterns. MethodologyThis study used photographs collected prospectively in Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana through our ongoing studies with use of digital health tools for clinical data documentation and for teledermatology. Our dataset included a total of 1,709 images from 506 patients. Two convolutional neural networks, ResNet-50 and VGG-16 models were adopted to examine the performance of different deep learning architectures and validate their feasibility in diagnosis of the targeted skin NTDs. Principal findingsThe two models were able to correctly predict over 70% of the diagnoses, and there was a consistent performance improvement with more training samples. The ResNet-50 model performed better than the VGG-16 model. Model trained with PCR confirmed cases of Buruli ulcer yielded 1-3% increase in prediction accuracy across all diseases besides for mycetoma, over a model which training sets included unconfirmed cases. ConclusionsOur approach was to have the deep learning model distinguish between multiple pathologies simultaneously-which is close to real-world practice. The more images used for training, the more accurate the diagnosis became. The percentages of correct diagnosis increased with PCR-positive cases of Buruli ulcer. This demonstrated that it may be better to input images from the more accurately diagnosed cases in the training models also for achieving better accuracy in the generated AI models. However, the increase was marginal which may be an indication that the accuracy of clinical diagnosis alone is reliable to an extent for Buruli ulcer. Diagnostic tests also have their flaws, and they are not always reliable. One hope for AI is that it will objectively resolve this gap between diagnostic tests and clinical diagnoses with the addition of another tool.

However, few studies have identified the complex interactive relationship between potential risk factors and severe dengue. This research aimed to assess the potential risk factors and detect their high-order combinative effects on severe dengue. A structured questionnaire was used to collect detailed dengue outbreak data from eight representative hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2019. Logistic regression and machine learning models were used to examine the complex effects of demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and biochemical markers on severe dengue. A total of 1,090 dengue cases (158 severe and 932 non-severe) were included in this study. Dyspnoea (Odds Ratio [OR] = 2.87, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.72 to 4.77), plasma leakage (OR = 3.61, 95% CI: 2.12 to 6.15), and hemorrhage (OR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.46 to 3.73) were positively and significantly associated with the occurrence of severe dengue. Classification and regression tree models showed that the probability of occurrence of severe dengue cases ranged from 7% (age >12.5 years without plasma leakage) to 92.9% (age <= 12.5 years with dyspnoea and plasma leakage). The random forest model indicated that age was the most important factor in predicting severe dengue, followed by education, plasma leakage, platelet, and dyspnoea. The research provides new evidence to identify key risk factors contributing to severe dengue cases, which could be beneficial to clinical doctors to identify and predict the severity of dengue early. Author summaryDengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection mostly in warm and tropical regions, which has been listed as one of the top ten global health threats by the WHO. Among neglected tropical diseases, the mortality of dengue is on the rise. Severe dengue (typically manifested by bleeding, organ dysfunction, and plasma leakage) has become a leading cause of hospitalization for children and adults. There is a higher risk of death if severe dengue cases are not appropriately managed. Therefore, finding biomarkers that can reliably predict the development of severe dengue in symptomatic individuals is one of the main focuses of current research efforts. We found that dyspnoea, plasma leakage, and hemorrhage were the independent risk factors of severe dengue. The predictive probability of occurrence of severe dengue achieved 92.9% among people aged <= 12.5 years with dyspnoea and plasma leakage. Establishing an early warning system for severe dengue based on these factors is essential for triaging in endemic areas.

However, detecting the disease using traditional dichotomous criteria (i.e., absent vs present) can be extremely difficult. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), due to their use of a large number of parameters for modeling, have shown the potential to improve prediction accuracy (ACC). To date, there has been no research conducted to understand item features and responses using online Rasch analysis. To verify the hypothesis that a combination of CNN, ANN, K-nearest-neighbor algorithm (KNN), and logistic regression (LR) can improve the ACC of DF prediction for children, further research is required. Methods:We extracted 19 feature variables related to DF symptoms from 177 pediatric patients, of whom 69 were diagnosed with DF. Using the RaschOnline technique for Rasch analysis, we examined 11 variables for their statistical significance in predicting the risk of DF. Based on 2 sets of data, 1 for training (80%) and the other for testing (20%), we calculated the prediction ACC by comparing the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) between DF + and DF- in both sets. In the training set, we compared 2 scenarios: the combined scheme and individual algorithms. Results:Our findings indicate that visual displays of DF data are easily interpreted using Rasch analysis; the k-nearest neighbors algorithm has a lower AUC (<0.50); LR has a relatively higher AUC (0.70); all 3 algorithms have an almost equal AUC (=0.68), which is smaller than the individual algorithms of Naive Bayes, LR in raw data, and Naive Bayes in normalized data; and we developed an app to assist parents in detecting DF in children during the dengue season.

In this age of machine learning (ML), there are several ML-based methods to do the task. This paper proposes an unorthodox method for malaria prognosis based on an extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm. In this regard, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), ELM, and double hidden layer (DELM) have been used as classifiers. A CNN model has been used as a feature extractor and also as a classifier to perform a comparative study. The derived features have been used to train ELM and DELM. Two versions of the malaria image dataset have been used: one is the original dataset, and the other is a modified dataset where ambiguous samples have been removed. The parasite inflator acts as the shape increaser of the small, darker malaria parasites in the RBC images in order to detect malaria easily. CNN-DELM has achieved a sanguine result on every performance standard compared to CNN and CNN-ELM. The proposed CNN-DELM method has achieved 97.79% and 99.66% accuracy for the original version and the modified version, respectively.

Yet, the traditional means of ascertaining the host range of viruses, which involves field surveillance and laboratory experiments, is a laborious and demanding undertaking. A computational tool with the capability to reliably predict host ranges for novel viruses can provide timely responses in the prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases. The intricate nature of viral-host prediction involves issues such as data imbalance and deficiency. Therefore, developing highly accurate computational tools capable of predicting virus-host associations is a challenging and pressing demand.ResultsTo overcome the challenges of virus-host prediction, we present HostNet, a deep learning framework that utilizes a Transformer-CNN-BiGRU architecture and two enhanced sequence representation modules. The first module, k-mer to vector, pre-trains a background vector representation of k-mers from a broad range of virus sequences to address the issue of data deficiency. The second module, an adaptive sliding window, truncates virus sequences of various lengths to create a uniform number of informative and distinct samples for each sequence to address the issue of data imbalance. We assess HostNet's performance on a benchmark dataset of Rabies lyssavirus and an in-house dataset of Flavivirus. Our results show that HostNet surpasses the state-of-the-art deep learning-based method in host-prediction accuracies and F1 score.

Using human footprint index and machine learning, this study shows how the occurrence of six diverse vector-borne diseases responds to the intricate effects of human pressure. Predicting how increasing intensity of human-environment interactions affects pathogen transmission is essential to anticipate changing disease risks and identify appropriate mitigation strategies. Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are highly responsive to environmental changes, but such responses are notoriously difficult to isolate because pathogen transmission depends on a suite of ecological and social responses in vectors and hosts that may differ across species. Here we use the emerging tools of cumulative pressure mapping and machine learning to better understand how the occurrence of six medically important VBDs, differing in ecology from sylvatic to urban, respond to multidimensional effects of human pressure. We find that not only is human footprint-an index of human pressure, incorporating built environments, energy and transportation infrastructure, agricultural lands and human population density-an important predictor of VBD occurrence, but there are clear thresholds governing the occurrence of different VBDs. Across a spectrum of human pressure, diseases associated with lower human pressure, including malaria, cutaneous leishmaniasis and visceral leishmaniasis, give way to diseases associated with high human pressure, such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika.

Therefore, new diagnostic techniques based on digital image analysis using artificial intelligence tools can improve diagnosis and help automate it.Methods: In this study, a dataset of 2571 labeled thick blood smear images were created. YOLOv5x, Faster R-CNN, SSD, and RetinaNet object detection neural networks were trained on the same dataset to evaluate their performance in Plasmodium parasite detection. Attention modules were applied and compared with YOLOv5x results. To automate the entire diagnostic process, a prototype of 3D-printed pieces was designed for the robotization of conventional optical microscopy, capable of auto-focusing the sample and tracking the entire slide.Results: Comparative analysis yielded a performance for YOLOv5x on a test set of 92.10% precision, 93.50% recall, 92.79% F-score, and 94.40% mAP0.5 for leukocyte, early and mature Plasmodium trophozoites overall detection.

The inception block extracts rich characteristics from images of malaria cells using a pre-trained model, such as Inception V3, which facilitates efficient representation learning. Subsequently, the dynamic imperative capsule neural network detects malaria parasites in microscopic images by classifying them into parasitized and healthy cells, enabling the detection of malaria parasites.

However, image quality is often insufficient for the automation of such processing. A promising improvement concerns the acquisition of enriched information on samples. In particular, Quantitative Phase Imaging (QPI) techniques, which allow the digitization of the phase in complement to the intensity, are attracting growing interest. Such imaging allows the exploration of transparent objects not visible in the intensity image using the phase image only. Another direction proposes using stained images to reveal some characteristics of the cells in the intensity image; in this case, the phase information is not exploited. In this paper, we question the interest of using the bi-modal information brought by intensity and phase in a QPI acquisition when the samples are stained. We consider the problem of detecting parasitized red blood cells for diagnosing malaria from stained blood smears using a Deep Neural Network (DNN).

Our results demonstrate a significant difference between the chemical spaces of cruzain and T. cruzi inhibitors, with compounds with more hydrogen bond donors and rotatable bonds being more likely to be good cruzain inhibitors, but less likely to be active on T. cruzi.

Machine learning, incorporating ethnobotanical and plant trait data, provides a promising approach to improve the identification of antiplasmodial plants and accelerate the search for new plant-derived antiplasmodial compounds.

2023.0,diagnosis,University of Life Sciences in Lublin; Silesian University of Technology; University of Life Sciences in Lublin; University of Life Sciences in Lublin,"Malaria is a significant disease that affects both animals and humans. The four main Plasmodium species that cause human malaria are Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium ovale. Plasmodium knowlesi, a parasite typically infecting forest macaque monkeys, was recently revealed to be able to be transmitted by anophelines and provoke malaria in humans. This provides an increasing risk of spreading the disease to areas previously unaffected with it and infecting people during the increasingly popular travels abroad. Microscopic examination remains one of the most often used methods for its laboratory confirmation. These tests, however, should be performed immediately after receiving samples from a first -contact doctor to allow immediate therapy. This research presents a novel, semantic segmentation neural network architecture designed to quickly create a classification mask, giving the doctor information about the position, shape, and possible affiliation of detected elements. The evaluation method is based on a light microscope imagery and was created to overcome problems resulting from the human diagnosis specifics. There are 3 abstract classes containing healthy cells, cells with malaria and background. The outputted mask can be later mapped to a more readable form with the inclusion of contrasting colors, next to an original image for quick validation. Such an approach allows for semi-automatic recognition of possible disease, nevertheless still giving the final verdict to the specialist. The developed solution has achieved a high recognition accuracy of 96.65%, while the computer power requirements are kept at a minimum. The proposed solution can help reduce misclassification rates by providing additional data for the doctor and speed up the entire process with the early diagnosis made by a deep learning model.",CLIMATE-CHANGE; PLASMODIUM; PARASITES; DEATHS,,Malaria detection using custom Semantic Segmentation Neural Network Architecture,YES

The diagnosis of human schistosomiasis is mainly based on the microscopic detection of the parasite's eggs in the feces (i.e., for Schistosoma mansoni or Schistosoma japonicum) or urine (i.e., for Schistosoma haematobium) samples. However, these techniques have limited sensitivity, and microscopic expertise is waning outside endemic areas. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) has become the gold standard diagnostic method for the identification of bacteria and fungi in many microbiological laboratories. Preliminary studies have recently shown promising results for parasite identification using this method. The aims of this study were to develop and validate a species-specific database for adult Schistosoma identification, and to evaluate the effects of different storage solutions (ethanol and RNAlater) on spectra profiles. Methods Adult worms (males and females) of S. mansoni and S. japonicum were obtained from experimentally infected mice. Species identification was carried out morphologically and by cytochrome oxidase 1 gene sequencing. Reference protein spectra for the creation of an in-house MALDI-TOF MS database were generated, and the database evaluated using new samples. We employed unsupervised (principal component analysis) and supervised (support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, Random Forest, and partial least squares discriminant analysis) machine learning algorithms for the identification and differentiation of the Schistosoma species. Results All the spectra were correctly identified by internal validation. For external validation, 58 new Schistosoma samples were analyzed, of which 100% (58/58) were correctly identified to genus level (log score values >= 1.7) and 81% (47/58) were reliably identified to species level (log score values >= 2). The spectra profiles showed some differences depending on the storage solution used. All the machine learning algorithms classified the samples correctly.

Objective: To associate the results of the ML Flow test with the clinical characteristics of leprosy cases and to verify their positivity in household contacts, in addition to describing the epidemiological profile of both. Methods: Prospective study with patients diagnosed over the course of one year (n = 26), without prior treatment, and their household contacts (n = 44) in six municipalities in northwestern Sao Paulo, Brazil. Results: There was a predominance of men among the leprosy cases, of 61.5% (16/26); 77% (20/26) were over 35 years old; 86.4% (22/26) were multibacillary; 61.5% (16/26) had a positive bacilloscopy; and 65.4% (17/26) had no physical disability. The ML Flow test was positive in 53.8% (14/26) of the leprosy cases and was associated with those who had a positive bacilloscopy and were diagnosed as multibacillary (p-value <0.05). Among the household contacts, 52.3% (23/44) were women and aged over 35 years; 81.8% (36/44) had been vaccinated with BCG - Bacillus Calmette-Guerin. The ML Flow test was positive in 27.3% (12/44) of household contacts, all of whom lived with multibacillary cases; seven lived with positive bacilloscopy cases and six with consanguineous cases. Study limitations: Difficulty in convincing the contacts to undergo the evaluation and collection of the clinical sample. Conclusion: The ML Flow test, when positive in household contacts, can help the identification of cases that require more attention by the health team, as it indicates a predisposition to disease development, especially when they are household contacts of multibacillary cases, with positive bacilloscopy and consanguineous. The ML Flow test also helps in the correct clinical classification of the leprosy cases. (c) 2023 Sociedade Brasileira de Dermatologia. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Meanwhile, geospatial analyses that rely on remotely sensed data are becoming popular tools for identifying environmental conditions that contribute to pathogen emergence and persistence.MethodsIn this study, we assessed whether open-source environmental data can be used to predict the presence of human Schistosoma japonicum infections among households with a similar or improved degree of accuracy compared to prediction models developed using data from comprehensive snail surveys. To do this, we used infection data collected from rural communities in Southwestern China in 2016 to develop and compare the predictive performance of two Random Forest machine learning models: one built using snail survey data, and one using open-source environmental data.ResultsThe environmental data models outperformed the snail data models in predicting household S. japonicum infection with an estimated accuracy and Cohen's kappa value of 0.89 and 0.49, respectively, in the environmental model, compared to an accuracy and kappa of 0.86 and 0.37 for the snail model. The Normalized Difference in Water Index (an indicator of surface water presence) within half to one kilometer of the home and the distance from the home to the nearest road were among the top performing predictors in our final model. Homes were more likely to have infected residents if they were further from roads, or nearer to waterways.ConclusionOur results suggest that in low-transmission environments, leveraging open-source environmental data can yield more accurate identification of pockets of human infection than using snail surveys. Furthermore, the variable importance measures from our models point to aspects of the local environment that may indicate increased risk of schistosomiasis. For example, households were more likely to have infected residents if they were further from roads or were surrounded by more surface water, highlighting areas to target in future surveillance and control efforts.",WATER INDEX NDWI; MANSONI; INFECTION; PREDICTION; HABITATS; SICHUAN; CHINA,,Open-source environmental data as an alternative to snail surveys to assess schistosomiasis risk in areas approaching elimination,YES

This study aims to evaluate Malaria Screener, a smartphone-based application for malaria diagnosis.MethodsA total of 190 patients were recruited at two sites in rural areas near Khartoum, Sudan. The Malaria Screener mobile application was deployed to screen Giemsa-stained blood smears. Both expert microscopy and nested PCR were performed to use as reference standards. First, Malaria Screener was evaluated using the two reference standards. Then, during post-study experiments, the evaluation was repeated for a newly developed algorithm, PlasmodiumVF-Net.ResultsMalaria Screener reached 74.1% (95% CI 63.5-83.0) accuracy in detecting Plasmodium falciparum malaria using expert microscopy as the reference after a threshold calibration. It reached 71.8% (95% CI 61.0-81.0) accuracy when compared with PCR. The achieved accuracies meet the WHO Level 3 requirement for parasite detection. The processing time for each smear varies from 5 to 15 min, depending on the concentration of white blood cells (WBCs). In the post-study experiment, Malaria Screener reached 91.8% (95% CI 83.8-96.6) accuracy when patient-level results were calculated with a different method. This accuracy meets the WHO Level 1 requirement for parasite detection. In addition, PlasmodiumVF-Net, a newly developed algorithm, reached 83.1% (95% CI 77.0-88.1) accuracy when compared with expert microscopy and 81.0% (95% CI 74.6-86.3) accuracy when compared with PCR, reaching the WHO Level 2 requirement for detecting both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria, without using the testing sites data for training or calibration.

Numerous studies have been conducted in Malaysian Borneo to determine the association between environmental factors and knowlesi malaria transmission. However, there is still a lack of understanding of the environmental influence on knowlesi malaria transmission in Peninsular Malaysia. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the ecological distribution of human P. knowlesi malaria in relation to environmental factors in Peninsular Malaysia. A total of 2,873 records of human P. knowlesi infections in Peninsular Malaysia from 1st January 2011 to 31st December 2019 were collated from the Ministry of Health Malaysia and geolocated. Three machine learning-based models, maximum entropy (MaxEnt), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and ensemble modeling approach, were applied to predict the spatial variation of P. knowlesi disease risk. Multiple environmental parameters including climate factors, landscape characteristics, and anthropogenic factors were included as predictors in both predictive models. Subsequently, an ensemble model was developed based on the output of both MaxEnt and XGBoost. Comparison between models indicated that the XGBoost has higher performance as compared to MaxEnt and ensemble model, with AUC(ROC) values of 0.933 +/- 0.002 and 0.854 +/- 0.007 for train and test datasets, respectively.

However, there is no clear recommendation on how to select patients for testing in endemic regions. Since most cases of Chronic ChD are asymptomatic, the diagnostic rates are low, preventing patients from receiving adequate treatment.The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely available, low-cost exam, often available in primary care settings. We present an Artificial intelligence (AI) model for automatically detecting ChD from the ECG. AI algorithms have allowed the detection of hidden conditions on the ECG and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that does it for ChD. We utilize large cohorts of patients from the relevant population of all-comers in affected regions in Brazil to develop a model for ChD detection that is then validated on datasets with ground truth labels obtained directly from the patients' serological status.Our findings demonstrate a promising AI-ECG-based model for discriminating patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC). The capacity of detecting ChD patients without CCC is still limited. But we believe this can be improved with the addition of epidemiological questions, and that such models can become useful tools for pre-selecting patients for further testing. BackgroundWorldwide, it is estimated that over 6 million people are infected with Chagas disease (ChD). It is a neglected disease that can lead to severe heart conditions in its chronic phase. While early treatment can avoid complications, the early-stage detection rate is low. We explore the use of deep neural networks to detect ChD from electrocardiograms (ECGs) to aid in the early detection of the disease. MethodsWe employ a convolutional neural network model that uses 12-lead ECG data to compute the probability of a ChD diagnosis. Our model is developed using two datasets which jointly comprise over two million entries from Brazilian patients: The SaMi-Trop study focusing on ChD patients, enriched with data from the CODE study from the general population. The model's performance is evaluated on two external datasets: the REDS-II, a study focused on ChD with 631 patients, and the ELSA-Brasil study, with 13,739 civil servant patients. FindingsEvaluating our model, we obtain an AUC-ROC of 0.80 (CI 95% 0.79-0.82) for the validation set (samples from CODE and SaMi-Trop), and in external validation datasets: 0.68 (CI 95% 0.63-0.71) for REDS-II and 0.59 (CI 95% 0.56-0.63) for ELSA-Brasil. In the latter, we report a sensitivity of 0.52 (CI 95% 0.47-0.57) and 0.36 (CI 95% 0.30-0.42) and a specificity of 0.77 (CI 95% 0.72-0.81) and 0.76 (CI 95% 0.75-0.77), respectively. Additionally, when considering only patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy as positive, the model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.82 (CI 95% 0.77-0.86) for REDS-II and 0.77 (CI 95% 0.68-0.85) for ELSA-Brasil. InterpretationThe neural network detects chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) from ECG-with weaker performance for early-stage cases.

Malaria is one of the endemic infectious diseases of Iran, whose transmission is strongly influenced by climatic conditions. The effect of climate change on malaria in the southeastern Iran from 2021 to 2050 was simulated by using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Gamma test (GT) and general circulation models (GCMs) were used to determine the best delay time and to generate the future climate model under two distinct scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). To simulate the various impacts of climate change on malaria infection, ANNs were applied using daily collected data for 12 years (from 2003 to 2014). The future climate of the study area will be hotter by 2050. The simulation of malaria cases elucidated that there is an intense increasing trend in malaria cases under the RCP8.5 scenario until 2050, with the highest number of infections occurring in the warmer months.

The identification of hotspot areas under active surveillance is a fundamental procedure for controlling disease transmission. Microscopic examination is a commonly used diagnostic method. It is, nevertheless, primarily reliant on skilled and experienced personnel. To address this issue, an artificial intelligence (AI) program was introduced that makes use of a hybrid deep learning technique of object identification and object classification neural network backbones on the in-house low-code AI platform (CiRA CORE). The program can identify and classify the protozoan trypanosome species, namely Trypanosoma cruzi, T. brucei, and T. evansi, from oil-immersion microscopic images. The AI program utilizes pattern recognition to observe and analyze multiple protozoa within a single blood sample and highlights the nucleus and kinetoplast of each parasite as specific characteristic features using an attention map. To assess the AI program's performance, two unique modules are created that provide a variety of statistical measures such as accuracy, recall, specificity, precision, F1 score, misclassification rate, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, and precision versus recall (PR) curves. The assessment findings show that the AI algorithm is effective at identifying and categorizing parasites.

The NTD leishmaniasis is now endemic in over 90 tropical and sub-tropical low socioeconomic countries. Current diagnosis for this disease involves serological assessment of infected tissue by either light microscopy, antibody tests, or culturing with in vitro or in vivo animal inoculation. Furthermore, co-infection by other pathogens can make it difficult to accurately determine Leishmania infection with light microscopy. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate the potential of combining synchrotron Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy with powerful discrimination tools, such as partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), support vector machine-discriminant analysis (SVM-DA), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN), to characterize the parasitic forms of Leishmania major both isolated and within infected macrophages. For measurements performed on functional infected and uninfected macrophages in physiological solutions, the sensitivities from PLS-DA, SVM-DA, and KNN classification methods were found to be 0.923, 0.981, and 0.989, while the specificities were 0.897, 1.00, and 0.975, respectively. Cross-validated PLS-DA models on live amastigotes and promastigotes showed a sensitivity and specificity of 0.98 in the lipid region, while a specificity and sensitivity of 1.00 was achieved in the fingerprint region.

2023.0,diagnosis,Jimma University,"BackgroundManual microscopic examination remains the golden standard for malaria diagnosis. But it is laborious, and pathologists with experience are needed for accurate diagnosis. The need for computer-aided diagnosis methods is driven by the enormous workload and difficulties associated with manual microscopy based examination. While the importance of computer-aided diagnosis is increasing at an enormous pace, fostered by the advancement of deep learning algorithms, there are still challenges in detecting small objects such as malaria parasites in microscopic images of blood films. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning-based object detection models are inefficient in detecting small objects accurately because they are underrepresented on benchmark datasets. The performance of these models is affected by the loss of detailed spatial information due to in-network feature map downscaling. This is due to the fact that the SOTA models cannot directly process high-resolution images due to their low-resolution network input layer.MethodsIn this study, an efficient and robust tile-based image processing method is proposed to enhance the performance of malaria parasites detection SOTA models. Three variants of YOLOV4-based object detectors are adopted considering their detection accuracy and speed. These models were trained using tiles generated from 1780 high-resolution P. falciparum-infected thick smear microscopic images. The tiling of high-resolution images improves the performance of the object detection models. The detection accuracy and the generalization capability of these models have been evaluated using three datasets acquired from different regions.ResultsThe best-performing model using the proposed tile-based approach outperforms the baseline method significantly (Recall, [95.3%] vs [57%] and Average Precision, [87.1%] vs [76%]). Furthermore, the proposed method has outperformed the existing approaches that used different machine learning techniques evaluated on similar datasets.ConclusionsThe experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves P. falciparum detection from thick smear microscopic images while maintaining real-time detection speed. Furthermore, the proposed method has the potential to assist and reduce the workload of laboratory technicians in malaria-endemic remote areas of developing countries where there is a critical skill gap and a shortage of experts.",THICK BLOOD SMEARS,,Tile-based microscopic image processing for malaria screening using a deep learning approach,YES

The diagnosis of malaria infection is conventionally performed by laboratorians through visual examination of blood smear images under a microscope. However, the results of such diagnostic testing depend on the laboratory technicians' experience with staining and image interpretation, which can be severely lacking in low-resource settings. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have great potential for automated malaria diagnosis from images without the need of human expert interaction. However, studies have shown that current CNNs are not robust to adversarial noises which are small input perturbations that cause CNNs to incorrectly classify medical images. In this study, we developed a CNN for malaria parasite identification and evaluated it on a dataset of 27,558 cell images through patient-level cross validation. To improve robustness against adversarial noises for this application, the structure of the CNN was specially designed to limit the receptive field of the output, and adversarial training was applied with gradually increasing level of noises. Compared to three baseline networks (ResNet-18, MobileNet, and MnasNet) and two variants of the CNN, our custom-designed CNN achieved a substantially lower computation cost and better adversarial robustness against PGD-generated adversarial noises on the malaria image dataset.

We create a robust image dataset of urine samples obtained from field settings and develop a two-stage diagnosis framework for urogenital schistosomiasis. Approach: Urine samples obtained from field settings were captured using the Schistoscope device, and S. haematobium eggs present in the images were manually annotated by experts to create the SH dataset. Next, we develop a two-stage diagnosis framework, which consists of semantic segmentation of S. haematobium eggs using the DeepLabv3-MobileNetV3 deep convolutional neural network and a refined segmentation step using ellipse fitting approach to approximate the eggs with an automatically determined number of ellipses. We defined two linear inequality constraints as a function of the overlap coefficient and area of a fitted ellipses. False positive diagnosis resulting from over-segmentation was further minimized using these constraints. We evaluated the performance of our framework on 7605 images from 65 independent urine samples collected from field settings in Nigeria, by deploying our algorithm on an Edge AI system consisting of Raspberry Pi + Coral USB accelerator. Result: The SH dataset contains 12,051 images from 103 independent urine samples and the developed urogenital schistosomiasis diagnosis framework achieved clinical sensitivity, specificity, and precision of 93.8%, 93.9%, and 93.8%, respectively, using results from an experienced microscopist as reference.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the disease on morbidity and to describe demographic and socioeconomic factors in relation to the status of children with urogenital schistosomiasis in Mali.MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study in November 2021 of 971 children aged 6 to 14 years selected at random from six schools in three districts in the Kayes Region of Mali. Demographic and socioeconomic data were collected on survey forms. Clinical data were collected following a medical consultation. Hematuria was systematically searched for through the use of strips. The search for Schistosoma haematobium eggs in urine was done via the filtration method. The urinary tract was examined by ultrasound. Associations between each of these variables and disease infection were tested using multivariate logistic regression.ResultsThe overall prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis detected was 50.2%. The average intensity of infection was 36 eggs/10 ml of urine. The associated risk factors for urogenital schistosomiasis showed that children who bathed, used the river/pond as a domestic water source, and who habitually urinated in the river/pond were more affected (P < 0.05). Children with farming parents were most affected (P = 0.032). The collection of clinical signs revealed that boys had more pollakiuria (58.6%) and dysuria (46.4%) than girls. Ultrasound data showed that focal lesion rates were recorded in all villages with the lowest rate in Diakalel (56.1%).

Immunological biomarkers have often been used as a complementary approach to support clinical diagnosis in several infectious diseases. The lack of commercially available laboratory tests for conclusive early diagnosis of leprosy has motivated the search for novel methods for accurate diagnosis. In the present study, we describe an integrated analysis of a cytokine release assay using a machine learning approach to create a decision tree algorithm. This algorithm was used to classify leprosy clinical forms and monitor household contacts. Methods. A model of Mycobacterium leprae antigen-specific in vitro assay with subsequent cytokine measurements by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was employed to measure the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interferon-gamma, interleukin 4, and interleukin 10 (IL-10) in culture supernatants of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with leprosy, healthy controls, and household contacts. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was carried out to define each cytokine's global accuracy and performance indices to identify clinical subgroups. Results. Data demonstrated that TNF (control culture [CC]: AUC = 0.72; antigen-stimulated culture [Ml]: AUC = 0.80) and IL-10 (CC: AUC = 0.77; Ml: AUC = 0.71) were the most accurate biomarkers to classify subgroups of household contacts and patients with leprosy, respectively. Decision tree classifier algorithms for TNF analysis categorized subgroups of household contacts according to the operational classification with moderate accuracy (CC: 79% [48/61]; Ml: 84% [51/61]). Additionally, IL-10 analysis categorized leprosy patients' subgroups with moderate accuracy (CC: 73% [22/30] and Ml: 70% [21/30]). Conclusions.

The World Health Organization aims to halve this burden by 2030. To achieve this ambitious goal, we need to close the data gap in snake ecology and snakebite epidemiology and give healthcare providers up-to-date knowledge and access to better diagnostic tools. An essential first step is to improve the capacity to identify biting snakes taxonomically. The existence of AI-based identification tools for other animals offers an innovative opportunity to apply machine learning to snake identification and snakebite envenoming, a life-threatening situation. Methodology We developed an AI model based on Vision Transformer, a recent neural network architecture, and a comprehensive snake photo dataset of 386,006 training photos covering 198 venomous and 574 non-venomous snake species from 188 countries. We gathered photos from online biodiversity platforms (iNaturalist and HerpMapper) and a photo-sharing site (Flickr).

2022.0,diagnosis,University of Cagliari,"Malaria is a globally widespread disease caused by parasitic protozoa transmitted to humans by infected female mosquitoes of Anopheles. It is caused in humans only by the parasite Plasmodium, further classified into four different species. Identifying malaria parasites is possible by analysing digital microscopic blood smears, which is tedious, time-consuming and error prone. So, automation of the process has assumed great importance as it helps the laborious manual process of review and diagnosis. This work focuses on deep learning-based models, by comparing off-the-shelf architectures for classifying healthy and parasite-affected cells, by investigating the four-class classification on the Plasmodium falciparum stages of life and, finally, by evaluating the robustness of the models with cross-dataset experiments on two different datasets. The main contributions to the research in this field can be resumed as follows: (i) comparing off-the-shelf architectures in the task of classifying healthy and parasite-affected cells, (ii) investigating the four-class classification on the P. falciparum stages of life and (iii) evaluating the robustness of the models with cross-dataset experiments. Eleven well-known convolutional neural networks on two public datasets have been exploited. The results show that the networks have great accuracy in binary classification, even though they lack few samples per class. Moreover, the cross-dataset experiments exhibit the need for some further regulations. In particular, ResNet-18 achieved up to 97.68% accuracy in the binary classification, while DenseNet-201 reached 99.40% accuracy on the multiclass classification. The cross-dataset experiments exhibit the limitations of deep learning approaches in such a scenario, even though combining the two datasets permitted DenseNet-201 to reach 97.45% accuracy. Naturally, this needs further investigation to improve the robustness. In general, DenseNet-201 seems to offer the most stable and robust performance, offering as a crucial candidate to further developments and modifications. Moreover, the mobile-oriented architectures showed promising and satisfactory performance in the classification of malaria parasites.

Automated diagnosis of malarial infection using AI-enabled IoMT holds the promise of sustainable prognosis by reducing diagnosis error significantly with improved recognition accuracy. Existing automated diagnostic systems usually employ classical deep learning models wherein setting parameter values such as automatic learning rate selection, weight management etc. are a major concern. To address these issues, this paper proposes a collaborative ensemble AI-enabled IoMT automated diagnosis model to classify malaria parasitized from microscopic images. The proposed model consists of two main stages. In the first stage, a Snapshot ensemble learning model is conjured upon by a combination of three distinct layers of Convolutional, Batch Normalization, and Relu networks; that alters the learning rate aggressively during training phase thus providing different network weights that gives multiple models by training a single model. In the second stage, an ensemble of three transfer learning models is constructed, and finally the average ensemble result is obtained. The learning rates at both these stages are empirically selected through Cosine Annealing.

Globally, billions of people are at risk of infection, imposing significant economic and public health burdens. As such, efficient methods to monitor mosquito populations and prevent the spread of these diseases are at a premium. One proposed technique is to apply acoustic monitoring to the challenge of identifying wingbeats of individual mosquitoes. Although researchers have successfully used wingbeats to survey mosquito populations, implementation of these techniques in areas most affected by mosquito-borne diseases remains challenging. Here, methods utilizing easily accessible equipment and encouraging community-scientist participation are more likely to provide sufficient monitoring. We present a practical, community-science-based method of monitoring mosquito populations using smartphones. We applied deep-learning algorithms (TensorFlow Inception v3) to spectrogram images generated from smartphone recordings associated with six mosquito species to develop a multiclass mosquito identification system, and flag potential invasive vectors not present in our sound reference library. Though TensorFlow did not flag potential invasive species with high accuracy, it was able to identify species present in the reference library at an 85% correct identification rate, an identification rate markedly higher than similar studies employing expensive recording devices. Given that we used smartphone recordings with limited sample sizes, these results are promising.

This research attempts to demonstrate the extensive applications of MCDA in the field of public health and to illustrate its utility with the combined use of spatial models and machine learning. The study investigates the risk factors for communicable diseases with a focus on vector-borne infectious diseases, such as West Nile Virus (WNV), malaria, dengue, etc. It aims to quantify vector-borne disease risk by examining the geographic contextual effects of socio-economic, climatic, and environmental factors using the objective-weighting technique adopted from MCDA and machine learning in a geographic information systems (GIS) framework. The authors attempted to minimize subjective bias from the decision space by utilizing an objective-weighted technique to quantify the risk. The study adopted Shannon's entropy to derive weights for each factor and its classes. The derived weighted layers are fed to an artificial neural network to obtain a final map of risk susceptibility. This final risk map allows policymakers to examine vulnerable areas and identify the factors pivotal to the contribution of risk. Findings show the traffic volume as the most influential variable, and terrain slope as the least one in the disease spread for the study area. The risk appears to be concentrated and distributed along vegetation, wetlands, and around water bodies. The results produced by ensemble learning show great promise with more than 94% accuracy.

Most of these deaths occur as a result of a delayed or incorrect diagnosis. At the moment, the manual microscope is considered to be the most effective equipment for diagnosing malaria. It is, on the other hand, time-consuming and prone to human error. Because it is such a serious global health issue, it is important that the evaluation process be automated. The objective of this article is to advocate for the automation of the diagnosis process in order to eliminate the need for human intervention in the process. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other deep-learning technologies, such as image processing, are being utilized to evaluate parasitemia in microscopic blood slides in order to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The approach is based on the intensity characteristics of Plasmodium parasites and erythrocytes, which are both known to be variable. Images of infected and noninfected erythrocytes are gathered and fed into the CNN models ResNet50, ResNet34, VGG-16, and VGG-19, which are all trained on the same dataset.

Early diagnosis and prompt effective treatment are the basis for the management of malaria and for reducing malaria mortality and morbidity worldwide and the key to malaria elimination. While Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) remains the current mainstay testing malaria infections, it is usually used in conjunction with clinical findings and lab tests of blood films through Microscopy- the gold standard of malaria diagnosis. Recent reports suggest that the accuracy of RDTs could be compromised due to parasite antigen gene deletion(s), and the lack of expertise and high turnover time makes microscopy impractical to be used in rural and remote areas which impede the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Delay in receiving treatment for uncomplicated malaria is reported to increase the risk of developing severe malaria and mortality. Thus, the need to develop advanced, faster, and smarter tools for malaria diagnosis is paramount, specially to reinforce the gold standard method, i.e., malaria microscopy which is a full-proof tool given the limitations be addressed. Deep learning-based methods have proven to provide human expert level performance on object detection/classification on image data. Such methods can be utilized for automation of repetitive task in assessing large number of microscope images of blood samples.

The development of an early-warning system for DF has been selected as a prioritised health adaptation measure to climate change in Vietnam. Objective This study aimed to develop an accurate DF prediction model in Vietnam using a wide range of meteorological factors as inputs to inform public health responses for outbreak prevention in the context of future climate change. Methods Convolutional neural network (CNN), Transformer, long short-term memory (LSTM), and attention-enhanced LSTM (LSTM-ATT) models were compared with traditional machine learning models on weather-based DF forecasting. Models were developed using lagged DF incidence and meteorological variables (measures of temperature, humidity, rainfall, evaporation, and sunshine hours) as inputs for 20 provinces throughout Vietnam. Data from 1997-2013 were used to train models, which were then evaluated using data from 2014-2016 by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Results and discussion LSTM-ATT displayed the highest performance, scoring average places of 1.60 for RMSE-based ranking and 1.95 for MAE-based ranking. Notably, it was able to forecast DF incidence better than LSTM in 13 or 14 out of 20 provinces for MAE or RMSE, respectively. Moreover, LSTM-ATT was able to accurately predict DF incidence and outbreak months up to 3 months ahead, though performance dropped slightly compared to short-term forecasts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time deep learning methods have been employed for the prediction of both long- and short-term DF incidence and outbreaks in Vietnam using unique, rich meteorological features.

2022.0,diagnosis,University of Vermont; University of Vermont; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Medicine,"Background Though significant progress in disease elimination has been made over the past decades, trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness globally. Further efforts in trachoma elimination are paradoxically being limited by the relative rarity of the disease, which makes clinical training for monitoring surveys difficult. In this work, we evaluate the plausibility of an Artificial Intelligence model to augment or replace human image graders in the evaluation/diagnosis of trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF). Methods We utilized a dataset consisting of 2300 images with a 5% positivity rate for TF. We developed classifiers by implementing two state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network architectures, ResNet101 and VGG16, and applying a suite of data augmentation/oversampling techniques to the positive images. We then augmented our data set with additional images from independent research groups and evaluated performance. Results Models performed well in minimizing the number of false negatives, given the constraint of the low numbers of images in which TF was present. The best performing models achieved a sensitivity of 95% and positive predictive value of 50-70% while reducing the number images requiring skilled grading by 66-75%. Basic oversampling and data augmentation techniques were most successful at improving model performance, while techniques that are grounded in clinical experience, such as highlighting follicles, were less successful. Discussion The developed models perform well and significantly reduce the burden on graders by minimizing the number of false negative identifications. Further improvements in model skill will benefit from data sets with more TF as well as a range in image quality and image capture techniques used. While these models approach/meet the community-accepted standard for skilled field graders (i.e., Cohen's Kappa >0.7), they are insufficient to be deployed independently/clinically at this time; rather, they can be utilized to significantly reduce the burden on skilled image graders. Author summary Trachoma is an infectious disease, experienced primarily in the developing world, and is a leading cause of global blindness. As recent efforts to address the disease have led to a significant reduction in disease prevalence, it has become difficult to train health workers to detect trachoma, due to its rarity; this if often referred to as the last mile problem. To address this issue, we have implemented a convolutional neural network to detect the presence of TF in images of everted eyelids. The trained network has comparable performance to trained, but non-expert, human image graders. Further, we found that misclassified images were typically characterized by poor image quality (e.g., blurry, eyelid not in image, etc.), which could be addressed by a standardization of the image acquisition protocol.",PHOTOGRAPHS,National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health [P20GM125498],Detection of trachoma using machine learning approaches,YES
2022.0,drug discovery,"National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education & Research, S.A.S. Nagar (Mohali)","Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease and the leading cause of death globally. The rapidly emerging cases of drug resistance among pathogenic mycobacteria have been a global threat urging the need of new drug discovery and development. However, considering the fact that the new drug discovery and development is commonly lengthy and costly processes, strategic use of the cutting-edge machine learning (ML) algorithms may be very supportive in reducing both the cost and time involved. Considering the urgency of new drugs for TB, herein, we have attempted to develop predictive ML algorithms-based models useful in the selection of novel potential small molecules for subsequent in vitro validation. For this purpose, we used the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) TCAMS TB dataset comprising a total of 776 hits that were made publicly available to the wider scientific community through the ChEMBL Neglected Tropical Diseases (ChEMBL-NTD) database. After exploring the different ML classifiers, viz. decision trees (DT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BNB), K-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and linear logistic regression (LLR), and ensemble learning models (bagging and Adaboost) for training the model using the GSK dataset, we concluded with three best models, viz. Adaboost decision tree (ABDT), RF classifier, and k-NN models that gave the top prediction results for both the training and test sets. However, during the prediction of the external set of known anti-tubercular compounds/drugs, it was realized that each of these models had some limitations. The ABDT model correctly predicted 22 molecules as actives, while both the RF and k-NN models predicted 18 molecules correctly as actives; a number of molecules were predicted as actives by two of these models, while the third model predicted these compounds as inactives. Therefore, we concluded that while deciding the anti-tubercular potential of a new molecule, one should rely on the use of consensus predictions using these three models; it may lessen the attrition rate during the in vitro validation. We believe that this study may assist the wider anti-tuberculosis research community by providing a platform for predicting small molecules with subsequent validation for drug discovery and development.",,"Department of Pharmaceuticals; Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizes; NIPER, Kolkata",Development and validation of consensus machine learning-based models for the prediction of novel small molecules as potential anti-tubercular agents,YES

Over a one-year period, 357 blood samples were analysed, including 248 negative and 109 positive malaria samples.

Moreover, it provided accurate species identification asfalciparumor non-falciparumand parasitaemia determination in a very short time compared to other methods. We also demonstrated that XN-31 was a reliable method for patient follow-up on days 3, 7, and 28.

Although there have been several efforts in drug discovery projects for ZIKV in recent years, there are still no antiviral drugs approved to date. Here, we describe the results of a global collaborative crowdsourced open science project, the OpenZika project, from IBM's World Community Grid (WCG), which integrates different computational and experimental strategies for advancing a drug candidate for ZIKV. Initially, molecular docking protocols were developed to identify potential inhibitors of ZIKV NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5 RdRp), NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro), and NS3 helicase (NS3hel). Then, a machine learning (ML) model was built to distinguish active vs inactive compounds for the cytoprotective effect against ZIKV infection. We performed three independent target-based virtual screening campaigns (NS5 RdRp, NS2B-NS3pro, and NS3hel), followed by predictions by the ML model and other filters, and prioritized a total of 61 compounds for further testing in enzymatic and phenotypic assays. This yielded five non-nucleoside compounds which showed inhibitory activity against ZIKV NS5 RdRp in enzymatic assays (IC50 range from 0.61 to 17 mu M). Two compounds thermally destabilized NS3hel and showed binding affinity in the micromolar range (Kd range from 9 to 35 mu M). Moreover, the compounds LabMol-301 inhibited both NS5 RdRp and NS2B-NS3pro (IC50 of 0.8 and 7.4 mu M, respectively) and LabMol-212 thermally destabilized the ZIKV NS3hel (Kd of 35 mu M). Both also protected cells from death induced by ZIKV infection in in vitro cell-based assays. However, while eight compounds (including LabMol-301 and LabMol-212) showed a cytoprotective effect and prevented ZIKV-induced cell death, agreeing with our ML model for prediction of this cytoprotective effect, no compound showed a direct antiviral effect against ZIKV. Thus, the new scaffolds discovered here are promising hits for future structural optimization and for advancing the discovery of further drug candidates for ZIKV. Furthermore, this work has demonstrated the importance of the integration of computational and experimental approaches, as well as the potential of large-scale collaborative networks to advance drug discovery projects for neglected diseases and emerging viruses, despite the lack of available direct antiviral activity and cytoprotective effect data, that reflects on the assertiveness of the computational predictions.

To shorten the morbidity of malaria, accurate and fast diagnostic tools are to be implied with Artificial Intelligence. In this research, an automated, fast, and accurate diagnostic model for one-shot detection and classification of malaria thin blood smears were developed using the Deep Siamese Capsule Network (D-SCN) and contributions for our research are threefold. Firstly, we proposed the D-SCN model which consists of two crucial phases which are feature extraction and feature discrimination. Secondly, we implied an end-to-end trained capsule network with an imperative routing (IR) mechanism for the feature extraction phase to capture feature invariances. Finally, at the feature discrimination phase, Lorentz, L-1 and L-2 similarity metrics were proposed for the dissimilation of features. During experimentation, it is observed that the Lorentz similarity metric provided more discriminative capability by acquiring the least MSE at most of the instances. Further, an algorithm is proposed to obtain faster convergence by cautiously tuning the hyperparameters, and this aided in decreasing the noise scale in training the D-SCN. The experimental outcomes proved that D-SCN outperformed with the highest detection accuracy of 97.24% for Lorentz as a similarity measure, and the Capsule network with IR mechanism outperformed with the highest classification accuracy of 98.89%.

Various plasmodium parasites spread in the victim's blood cells and keep their life in a critical situation. If not treated at the early stage, malaria can cause even death. Microscopy is a familiar process for diagnosing malaria, collecting the victim's blood samples, and counting the parasite and red blood cells. However, the microscopy process is time-consuming and can produce an erroneous result in some cases. With the recent success of machine learning and deep learning in medical diagnosis, it is quite possible to minimize diagnosis costs and improve overall detection accuracy compared with the traditional microscopy method. This paper proposes a multiheaded attention-based transformer model to diagnose the malaria parasite from blood cell images.

The advent of digital microscopy and Machine learning with the aim of automating Plasmodium falciparum diagnosis extensively depends on the extracted image features. The color of the cells, plasma, and stained artifacts influence the topological, geometrical, and statistical parameters being used to extract image features. During microscopic image acquisition, custom adjustments to the condenser and color temperature controls often have an influence on the extracted statistical features. But, our human visual system sub-consciously adjusts the color and retains the originality in a different lighting environment. Despite the use of appropriate image preprocessing, findings from the literature indicate that statistical feature variations exist, allowing the risk of P. falciparum misinterpretation. In order to eliminate this pervasive variation, the current work focuses on preprocessing the extracted statistical features rather than the prepossessing of the source image. It begins with the augmentation of series images for a microscopic field by inducing illumination variations during the microscopic image acquisition stage. A set of such image series is analyzed using a Nonlinear Regression Model to generalize the relationship between microscopic images acquired with variable ambient brightness and a specific feature. The projection point of the centroid feature onto the brightness parameter is identified in the model and it is denoted as the optimum brightness factor (OBF). Using the model, the feature correction factor (CF) is calculated from the rate of change of feature values over the interval OBF, and the brightness of the test image is processed. The present work has investigated OBF for selected image textural features, namely Contrast, Homogeneity, Entropy, Energy, and Correlation individually from its co-occurrence matrices. For performance analysis, the best state-of-the-art method uses selected texture as a subset feature to evaluate the effectiveness of P. falciparum malaria classification. Then, the impact of proposed feature processing is evaluated on 274 blood smear images with and without Feature Correction (FC).

Our IMNS approach is to use small network modules that we call SubNets which are capable of generating salient features for a particular problem. Then, we build up ever larger and more powerful networks by combining these SubNets in different configurations. At each stage, only one new SubNet module undergoes learning updates. This reduces the computational resource requirements for training and aids in network optimization. We compare IMNets against classic and state-of-the-art deep learning architectures such as AlexNet, ResNet-50, Inception v3, DenseNet-201, and NasNet for the various experiments conducted in this study. Our proposed IMNS design leads to high average classification accuracies of 97.0%, 97.9%, and 88.6% for malaria, diabetic retinopathy, and tuberculosis, respectively. Our modular design for deep learning achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the scenarios tested. The IMNets produced here have a relatively low computational complexity compared to traditional deep learning architectures. The largest IMNet tested here has 0.95 M of the learnable parameters and 0.08 G of the floating-point multiply-add (MAdd) operations. The simpler IMNets train faster, have lower memory requirements, and process images faster than the benchmark methods tested.",ALGORITHM,,IMNets: Deep Learning Using an Incremental Modular Network Synthesis Approach for Medical Imaging Applications,YES

2022.0,diagnosis,Majmaah University,"Malaria is a severe disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, which can be detected through blood smear images. The early identification of the disease can effectively reduce the severity rate. Deep learning (DL) models can be widely employed to analyze biomedical images, thereby minimizing the misclassification rate. With this objective, this study developed an intelligent deep-transfer-learning-based malaria parasite detection and classification (IDTL-MPDC) model on blood smear images. The proposed IDTL-MPDC technique aims to effectively determine the presence of malarial parasites in blood smear images. In addition, the IDTL-MPDC technique derives median filtering (MF) as a pre-processing step. In addition, a residual neural network (Res2Net) model was employed for the extraction of feature vectors, and its hyperparameters were optimally adjusted using the differential evolution (DE) algorithm. The k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier was used to assign appropriate classes to the blood smear images. The optimal selection of Res2Net hyperparameters by the DE model helps achieve enhanced classification outcomes. A wide range of simulation analyses of the IDTL-MPDC technique are carried out using a benchmark dataset, and its performance seems to be highly accurate (95.86%), highly sensitive (95.82%), highly specific (95.98%), with a high F1 score (95.69%), and high precision (95.86%), and it has been proven to be better than the other existing methods.",,Deanship of Scientific Research at Majmaah University [R-2022-76],Intelligent Deep Transfer Learning Based Malaria Parasite Detection and Classification Model Using Biomedical Image,YES

Methods In a prospective cohort study in Uganda, we measured markers of intestinal injury (intestinal fatty-acid binding protein [I-FABP] and zonula occludens-1 [ZO-1]) and microbial translocation (lipopolysaccharide binding protein [LBP] and soluble complement of differentiation 14 [sCD14]) among children admitted with malaria. We examined their association with biomarkers of inflammation, endothelial activation, clinical signs of hypoperfusion, organ injury, and mortality. Results We enrolled 523 children (median age 1.5 years, 46% female, 7.5% mortality). Intestinal FABP was above the normal range (>= 400 pg/mL) in 415 of 523 patients (79%). Intestinal FABP correlated with ZO-1 (rho = 0.11, P = .014), sCD14 (rho = 0.12, P = .0046) as well as markers of inflammation and endothelial activation. Higher I-FABP levels were associated with lower systolic blood pressure (rho = -0.14, P = .0015), delayed capillary refill time (rho = 0.17, P = .00011), higher lactate level (rho = 0.40, P < .0001), increasing stage of acute kidney injury (rho = 0.20, P = .0034), and coma (P < .0001).

2022.0,diagnosis,Monash University; Monash University Malaysia,"In recent malaria research, the complexity of the disease has been explored using machine learning models via blood smear images, environmental, and even RNA-Seq data. However, a machine learning model based on genetic variation data is still required to fully explore individual malaria risk. Furthermore, many Genome-Wide Associations Studies (GWAS) have associated specific genetic markers, i.e., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with malaria. Thus, the present study improves the current state-of-the-art genetic risk score by incorporating SNPs mutation location on large-scale genetic variation data obtained from GWAS. Nevertheless, it becomes computationally expensive for hyperparameter optimization on large-scale datasets. Therefore, this study proposes a machine learning model that incorporates mutation location as well as a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize hyperparameters. Besides that, a deep learning model is also proposed to predict individual malaria risk as an alternative approach. The analysis is performed on the Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network (MalariaGEN) dataset comprising 20,817 individuals from 11 populations. The findings of this study demonstrated that the proposed GA could overcome the curse of dimensionality and improve resource efficiency compared to commonly used methods. In addition, incorporating the mutation location significantly improved the machine learning models in predicting the individual malaria risk; a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) score of 8.00E-06. Moreover, the deep learning model obtained almost similar MAE scores to the machine learning models, indicating an alternative approach.

Frequently, the disease manifests itself after a long time, accompanied by severe heart disease or by sudden death. Thus, the diagnosis is a complex and challenging process where several factors must be considered. In this paper, a novel pipeline is presented integrating temporal data from four modalities (electrocardiography signals, echocardiography images, Doppler spectrum, and ELISA antibody titers), multiple features selection analyses by a univariate analysis and a machine learning-based selection. The method includes an automatic dichotomous classification of animal status (control vs. infected) based on Random Forest, Extremely Randomized Trees, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machine. The most relevant multimodal attributes found were ELISA (IgGT, IgG1, IgG2a), electrocardiography (SR mean, QT and ST intervals), ascending aorta Doppler signals, and echocardiography (left ventricle diameter during diastole). Concerning automatic classification from selected features, the best accuracy of control vs. acute infection groups was 93.3 +/- 13.3% for cross-validation and 100% in the final test; for control vs. chronic infection groups, it was 100% and 100%, respectively.

Although over 42 million Brazilians are at risk of contracting malaria, 99% percent of all malaria cases in Brazil are located in or around the Amazon rainforest. Despite declining cases and deaths, malaria remains a major public health issue in Brazil. Accurate spatiotemporal prediction of malaria propagation may enable improved resource allocation to support efforts to eradicate the disease. Methods: In response to calls for novel research on malaria elimination strategies that suit local conditions, in this study, we propose machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to predict the probability of malaria cases in the state of Amazonas. Using a dataset of approximately 6 million records (January 2003 to December 2018), we applied k-means clustering to group cities based on their similarity of malaria incidence. We evaluated random forest, long-short term memory (LSTM) and dated recurrent unit (GRU) models and compared their performance. Results: The LSTM architecture achieved better performance in clusters with less variability in the number of cases, whereas the GRU presents better results in clusters with high variability. Although Diebold-Mariano testing suggested that both the LSTM and GRU performed comparably, GRU can be trained significantly faster, which could prove advantageous in practice. Conclusions: All models showed satisfactory accuracy and strong performance in predicting new cases of malaria, and each could serve as a supplemental tool to support regional policies and strategies.",ABSOLUTE ERROR MAE; ERADICATION; NETWORKS; BURDEN; RMSE,Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia de Pernambuco (FACEPE) [IBPG-0059-1.03/19]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq); Irish Institute of Digital Business (dotLAB),"Prediction of malaria using deep learning models: A case study on city clusters in the state of Amazonas, Brazil, from 2003 to 2018",YES

In particular, small-molecule agents with potent efficacy against both the liver and blood stages of Plasmodium parasite infection are critical for clinical settings as they would simultaneously prevent and treat malaria with a reduced selection pressure for resistance. While experimental screens for such dual-stage inhibitors have been conducted, the time and cost of these efforts limit their scope. Here, we have focused on leveraging machine learning approaches to discover novel antimalarials with such properties. A random forest modeling approach was taken to predict small molecules with in vitro efficacy versus liver-stage Plasmodium berghei parasites and a lack of human liver cell cytotoxicity. Empirical validation of the model was achieved with the realization of hits with liver-stage efficacy after prospective scoring of a commercial diversity library and consideration of structural diversity. A subset of these hits also demonstrated promising blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum efficacy.

2022.0,diagnosis,University of Nairobi,"Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) trace atomic species of diseased biofluids are subtle (peak-free) in complex spectra. Trace analysis requires a considerable push in analytical strategy. Enabling LIBS with chemometrics can help identify, extract, analyze and interpret the trace species' spectral signatures to give an insight on the biophysiological status of the bodies from which the biofluids originate. We report on the trace quantitative performance of peak-free LIBS enabled by chemometrics modelling using principal components analysis (PCA) for direct artificial neural network (ANN)-based analysis of Cu, Zn, Fe and Mg in Plasmodium falciparum-infected blood in the context of rapid spectral diagnosis of malaria utilizing the biometals as the disease biomarkers. Only one standard is required in this method-to delineate the analyte spectral regions (feature selection) and to test for accuracy. Based on the alteration of the biometal levels and their multivariate and correlational patterns in cultured blood, peripheral finger blood drops dried directly on Nucleopore membrane filters was accurately discriminated as either malaria-infected or healthy. Further the morphological evolution of Plasmodium was accurately predicted using spectral features of the biometals wherein high negative correlations between Fe (- 0.775) and Zn (- 0.881) and high positive correlations between Cu (0.892) and Mg (0.805) with parasitemia were observed. During the first 96 h of malaria infection Cu increases profoundly (from 328 to 1999 ppb) while Fe, Zn and Mg decrease (from 1206 to 674 ppb), (from 1523 to 499 ppb) and (from 23,880 to 19,573 ppb) respectively.

Although it has been largely eliminated, still about 200'000 new patients are diagnosed annually. In the absence of a diagnostic test, clinical diagnosis is often delayed, potentially leading to irreversible neurological damage and its resulting stigma, as well as continued transmission. Accelerating diagnosis could significantly contribute to advancing global leprosy elimination. Digital and Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven technology has shown potential to augment health workers abilities in making faster and more accurate diagnosis, especially when using images such as in the fields of dermatology or ophthalmology. That made us start the quest for an AI-driven diagnosis assistant for leprosy, based on skin images. Methods Here we describe the accuracy of an AI-enabled image-based diagnosis assistant for leprosy, called AI4Leprosy, based on a combination of skin images and clinical data, collected following a standardized process. In a Brazilian leprosy national referral center, 222 patients with leprosy or other dermatological conditions were included, and the 1229 collected skin images and 585 sets of metadata are stored in an open-source dataset for other researchers to exploit. Findings We used this dataset to test whether a CNN-based AI algorithm could contribute to leprosy diagnosis and employed three AI models, testing images and metadata both independently and in combination. AI modeling indicated that the most important clinical signs are thermal sensitivity loss, nodules and papules, feet paresthesia, number of lesions and gender, but also scaling surface and pruritus that were negatively associated with leprosy. Using elastic-net logistic regression provided a high classification accuracy (90%) and an area under curve (AUC) of 96.46% for leprosy diagnosis. Interpretation Future validation of these models is underway, gathering larger datasets from populations of different skin types and collecting images with smartphone cameras to mimic real world settings. We hope that the results of our research will lead to clinical solutions that help accelerate global leprosy elimination. Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Early recognition of pathogenic parasites can effectively constrain the spread of these infectious diseases. Recently, deep-learning-based computer-aided parasite recognition systems provide many practical tools for automated apicomplexan parasite recognition. However, existing research works are limited by the complicated and expensive manual annotating workload in supervised deep learning methods, which require many experts' manually annotated samples. Moreover, they also ignore the significance of correlations among different parasite cells, which retain helpful information for identification. Therefore, this paper is the first to employ a semi-supervised learning strategy to reduce the manual labeling workload and introduce a hybrid graph learning algorithm into parasite recognition. Our approach has a superior parasite recognition capability with semi-supervised techniques and the graph-based model. Specifically, this research proposes a Semi-Supervised Graph Learning (SSGL) framework, composing CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) feature embedding, learnable graph building, and graph feature learning components. To verify the performance of the SSGL model, the paper applies multiple evaluation indicators to appraise our model, and the approach can achieve high accuracy of 91.75%, AUC of 91.83%, the sensitivity of 91.75% and specificity of 97.25% with only a small amount of labeled data (20%). In conclusion, SSGL model provides high parasite recognition capability with minimal labels, greatly reduces the workload of relevant experts, and promotes the popularization of computer-aided parasite diagnosis tools.",PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM; MALARIA,,Semi-supervised graph learning framework for apicomplexan parasite classification,YES

Toosi University of Technology,"This study compares two adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and principal component analysis (PCA)-ANFIS techniques for spatial modeling and forecasting of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) cases in rural districts of Golestan province, Iran. We collected and prepared data on ZCL cases and climatic, topographic, vegetation, and human population factors. By applying the PCA algorithm, the parameters affecting the ZCL incidence were decomposed into principal components (PCs), and their dimensions were reduced. Then, PCs were used to train the ANFIS model. To evaluate the proposed approaches in model assessment phase, we used test data in 2016. In this phase, we showed that PCA-ANFIS model with values of R-2 = 0.791, MAE = 0.681, RMSE = 0.904 compared to ANFIS model with values of R-2 = 0.705, MAE = 0.827, RMSE = 1.073 has better performance in prediction of the ZCL cases. Actual and predicted maps of ZCL cases in 2016 by both models demonstrated that the high-risk regions of the disease are located in the northeastern, northern parts, and some central rural districts of Golestan province. Sensitivity analysis of the ANFIS model showed that population, vegetation, average wind speed, elevation, and average soil temperature, respectively, are the most significant factors in predicting the ZCL cases. The findings indicated the importance of machine learning (ML) techniques (ANFIS and PCA-ANFIS) in medical geography studies. By using these approaches, with less cost and shorter time, high-risk areas of diseases can be predicted, and the most effective factors on the spatial prediction of diseases can be identified.

Illuminating drivers of heterogeneity in prevalence over time and space would provide information for public health authorities. The objective of this study is to detect the spatiotemporal clusters and determine the risk factors of three major Aedes-borne diseases, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) clusters in Mexico. Methods We present an integrated analysis of Aedes-borne diseases (ABDs), the local climate, and the socio-demographic profiles of 2469 municipalities in Mexico. We used SaTScan to detect spatial clusters and utilize the Pearson correlation coefficient, Randomized Dependence Coefficient, and SHapley Additive exPlanations to analyze the influence of sociodemographic and climatic factors on the prevalence of ABDs. We also compare six machine learning techniques, including XGBoost, decision tree, Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function kernel, K nearest neighbors, random forest, and neural network to predict risk factors of ABDs clusters. Results DENV is the most prevalent of the three diseases throughout Mexico, with nearly 60.6% of the municipalities reported having DENV cases. For some spatiotemporal clusters, the influence of socio-economic attributes is larger than the influence of climate attributes for predicting the prevalence of ABDs. XGBoost performs the best in terms of precision-measure for ABDs prevalence. Conclusions Both socio-demographic and climatic factors influence ABDs transmission in different regions of Mexico.

More than 80% of people affected by CD will not have access to diagnosis and continued treatment, which partly supports the high morbidity and mortality rate. Machine Learning (ML) can identify patterns in data that can be used to increase our understanding of a specific problem or make predictions about the future. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate different models of ML to predict death in two years of patients with CD. ML models were developed using different techniques and configurations. The techniques used were: Random Forests, Adaptive Boosting, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Networks. The adopted settings considered only interview variables, only complementary exam variables, and finally, both mixed. Data from a cohort study with CD patients called SaMi-Trop were analyzed. The predictor variables came from the baseline; and the outcome, which was death, came from the first follow-up. All models were evaluated in terms of Sensitivity, Specificity and G-mean. Among the 1694 individuals with CD considered, 134 (7.9%) died within two years of follow-up. Using only the predictor variables from the interview, the different techniques achieved a maximum G-mean of 0.64 in predicting death. Using only the variables from complementary exams, the G-mean was up to 0.77. In this configuration, the protagonism of NT-proBNP was evident, where it was possible to observe that an ML model using only this single variable reached G-mean of 0.76.

2021.0,diagnosis,Open University - UK; Open University - UK,"The aim of this research was to discover if artificial neural networks can be used to classify pressure sensor data generated by medical detection dogs as they sniff biological samples. A detection dog can be trained to recognise the odour emitted by one of a wide range of diseases such as prostate cancer, malaria or, potentially, COVID-19. The dog searches a row of sample pots and indicates a positive sample by sitting in front of it. This offers a noninvasive means of diagnosing the specific cancer or disease that the dog has been trained to recognise. For this study, pressure sensors were attached to the sample pots to generate time series data pertaining to the dog's searching behaviour as they press their nose against the sample pot to sniff its content. Automatic classification could provide a second form of indication, to support or refute the dog's explicit signal (to sit at a positive sample), which is not always correct. Ultimately, classification software could eliminate the need for the dog to perform an indication gesture, making the dog's task easier and training quicker. Four different neural network architectures were evaluated: multilayer perceptron (MLP), a convolutional neural network (CNN), a fully convolutional network (FCN) and ResNet (a deep convolutional neural network). Each model was trained to classify the pressure data generated by medical detection dogs. To achieve a useful level of accuracy, it was found that the models needed to be trained using only those data samples where the dog had correctly classified the scent sample. Model hyperparameters were tuned to improve accuracy. We found that the best performing model was MLP. When tested on previously unseen data, where the dog was not always correct, the classification performance of the MLP approached that of the medical detection dogs. For our particular dataset, the model's true positive rate (i.e. recall) was 59%, matching that of the dogs. The model's true negative rate was 79%, compared to the dogs' 91%.",BIOMARKERS,,Artificial neural networks for classifying the time series sensor data generated by medical detection dogs,YES

Such information can be challenging to acquire in electronic health records, as it is often available only in unstructured text. Objective: This study aims to assess the feasibility of annotating and automatically extracting travel history mentions from unstructured clinical documents in the Department of Veterans Affairs across disparate health care facilities and among millions of patients. Information about travel exposure augments existing surveillance applications for increased preparedness in responding quickly to public health threats. Methods: Clinical documents related to arboviral disease were annotated following selection using a semiautomated bootstrapping process. Using annotated instances as training data, models were developed to extract from unstructured clinical text any mention of affirmed travel locations outside of the continental United States. Automated text processing models were evaluated, involving machine learning and neural language models for extraction accuracy. Results: Among 4584 annotated instances, 2659 (58%) contained an affirmed mention of travel history, while 347 (7.6%) were negated. Interannotator agreement resulted in a document-level Cohen kappa of 0.776. Automated text processing accuracy (F1 85.6, 95% CI 82.5-87.9) and computational burden were acceptable such that the system can provide a rapid screen for public health events. Conclusions: Automated extraction of patient travel history from clinical documents is feasible for enhanced passive surveillance public health systems. Without such a system, it would usually be necessary to manually review charts to identify recent travel or lack of travel, use an electronic health record that enforces travel history documentation, or ignore this potential source of information altogether. The development of this tool was initially motivated by emergent arboviral diseases. More recently, this system was used in the early phases of response to COVID-19 in the United States, although its utility was limited to a relatively brief window due to the rapid domestic spread of the virus.

2021.0,diagnosis,University of Detroit Mercy,"Chagas Disease (CD) is a vector-borne infectious disease transmitted from animals to humans and reversely. It is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (abbr. as T. cruzi). CD is forcing an enormous social burden on public health and counts as one of the most significant threats to human health. CD has two phases of acute and chronic. The diagnostic of CD can be performed at both phases, but it is not entirely curable in the chronic phase. Therefore, diagnosing and treating it in the acute phase plays an essential role in overcoming the disease. There are many clinical trials dedicated to solving this problem, but they are expensive and time-consuming. Computational methods (automatic identification) to solving this problem are limited. Therefore, this work focuses on the automatic identification of CD. It proposes four different automated CD vector identification approaches that classify several vectors of kissing bugs with acceptable and promising accuracy rates. Three of the proposed frameworks are data mining-based approaches composed of preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, data balancing, and classification steps. The Principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm is used for feature extraction, and three different classification techniques, including Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), are employed in the classification step. In the fourth approach, two different convolutional neural networks (CNN) structures are applied to the preprocessed dataset. The results are optimistic and outperform previously developed systems. The accuracy of 100% is achieved using PCA + DT and PCA + RF. By achieving 100% accuracy rates for the current most common dataset of kissing bugs, we get one step closer to overcome this rising fatal disease. Such an automatic system could provide a great help for healthcare clinicians in identifying and treating CD disease in an early phase to cure it completely.",TRYPANOSOMA-CRUZI INFECTION; RANDOM FOREST; CLASSIFICATION; TEXAS,,Automatic identification of Chagas disease vectors using data mining and deep learning techniques,YES

Differential etiologies of pediatric acute febrile respiratory illness pose challenges for all populations globally, but especially in malaria-endemic settings because the pathogens responsible overlap in clinical presentation and frequently occur together. Rapid identification of bacterial pneumonia with high-quality diagnostic tools would enable appropriate, point-of-care antibiotic treatment. Current diagnostics are insufficient, and the discovery and development of new tools is needed. We report a unique biomarker signature identified in blood samples to accomplish this. Methods. Blood samples from 195 pediatric Mozambican patients with clinical pneumonia were analyzed with an aptamer-based, high-dynamic-range, quantitative assay (similar to 1200 proteins). We identified new biomarkers using a training set of samples from patients with established bacterial, viral, or malarial pneumonia. Proteins with significantly variable abundance across etiologies (false discovery rate <0.01) formed the basis for predictive diagnostic models derived from machine learning techniques (Random Forest, Elastic Net). Validation on a dedicated test set of samples was performed. Results. Significantly different abundances between bacterial and viral infections (219 proteins) and bacterial infections and mixed (viral and malaria) infections (151 proteins) were found. Predictive models achieved >90% sensitivity and >80% specificity, regardless of number of pathogen classes. Bacterial pneumonia was strongly associated with neutrophil markers-in particular, degranulation including HP, LCN2, LTF, MPO, MMP8, PGLYRP1, RETN, SERPINA1, S100A9, and SLPI. Conclusions. Blood protein signatures highly associated with neutrophil biology reliably differentiated bacterial pneumonia from other causes.

Blood transcriptomic biomarkers that prospectively predict those who progress to leprosy (progressors) would allow early diagnosis, better treatment outcomes and facilitate interventions aimed at stopping bacterial transmission. To identify potential risk signatures of leprosy, we collected whole blood of household contacts (HC, n=5,352) of leprosy patients, including individuals who were diagnosed with leprosy 4-61 months after sample collection. Methods: We investigated differential gene expression (DGE) by RNA-Seq between progressors before pres-ence of symptoms (n=40) and HC (n=40), as well as longitudinal DGE within each progressor. A prospective leprosy signature was identified using a machine learning approach (Random Forest) and validated using reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Findings: Although no significant intra-individual longitudinal variation within leprosy progressors was iden-tified, 1,613 genes were differentially expressed in progressors before diagnosis compared to HC. We identi-fied a 13-gene prospective risk signature with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 95.2%. Validation of this RNA-Seq signature in an additional set of progressors (n=43) and HC (n=43) by RT-qPCR, resulted ina final 4 -gene signature, designated RISK4LEP (MT-ND2, REX1BD, TPGS1, UBC) (AUC=86.4%). Interpretation: This study identifies for the first time a prospective transcriptional risk signature in blood pre-dicting development of leprosy 4 to 61 months before clinical diagnosis. Assessment of this signature in con-tacts of leprosy patients can function as an adjunct diagnostic tool to target implementation of interventions to restrain leprosy development.

In this study, four types of deep convolutional neural networks, namely Darknet, Darknet19, Darknet19-448 and Densenet201 are used to classify P. gallinaceum blood stages. We randomly collected a dataset of 12,761 single-cell images consisting of three parasite stages from ten-infected blood films stained by Giemsa. All images were confirmed by three well-trained examiners. The study mainly compared several image classification models and used both qualitative and quantitative data for the evaluation of the proposed models. In the model-wise comparison, the four neural network models gave us high values with a mean average accuracy of at least 97%. The Darknet can reproduce a superior performance in the classification of the P. gallinaceum development stages across any other model architectures. Furthermore, the Darknet has the best performance in multiple class-wise classification, with average values of greater than 99% in accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. It also has a low misclassification rate (< 1%) than the other three models. Therefore, the model is more suitable in the classification of P. gallinaceum blood stages.

We tested our method on an archived collection of human malaria smears with nearly 200,000 labeled cells across 965 images from 193 patients, acquired in Bangladesh, with each patient contributing five images. Cell detection accuracy using RBCNet was higher than 97%. The novel dual cascade RBCNet architecture provides more accurate cell detections because the foreground cell-cluster masks from U-Net adaptively guide the detection stage, resulting in a notably higher true positive and lower false alarm rates, compared to traditional and other deep learning methods.

Traditional surveillance of mosquitoes, vectors of many diseases, relies on catches, which requires regular manual inspection and reporting, and dedicated personnel, making large-scale monitoring difficult and expensive. New approaches are solving the problem of scalability by relying on smartphones and the Internet to enable novel community-based and digital observatories, where people can upload pictures of mosquitoes whenever they encounter them. An example is the Mosquito Alert citizen science system, which includes a dedicated mobile phone app through which geotagged images are collected. This system provides a viable option for monitoring the spread of various mosquito species across the globe, although it is partly limited by the quality of the citizen scientists' photos. To make the system useful for public health agencies, and to give feedback to the volunteering citizens, the submitted images are inspected and labeled by entomology experts. Although citizen-based data collection can greatly broaden disease-vector monitoring scales, manual inspection of each image is not an easily scalable option in the long run, and the system could be improved through automation.

Malaria is a fatal disease that is endemic in many regions of the world. Quick diagnosis of this disease will be very valuable for patients, as traditional methods require tedious work for its detection. Recently, some automated methods have been proposed that exploit hand-crafted feature extraction techniques however, their accuracies are not reliable. Deep learning approaches modernize the world with their superior performance. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are vastly scalable for image classification tasks that extract features through hidden layers of the model without any handcrafting. The detection of malaria-infected red blood cells from segmented microscopic blood images using convolutional neural networks can assist in quick diagnosis, and this will be useful for regions with fewer healthcare experts. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we evaluate the performance of different existing deep learning models for efficient malaria detection. Second, we propose a customized CNN model that outperforms all observed deep learning models. It exploits the bilateral filtering and image augmentation techniques for highlighting features of red blood cells before training the model.

From Ebola, Zika, to the latest COVID-19 pandemic, outbreaks of highly infectious diseases continue to reveal severe consequences of social and health inequalities. People from low socioeconomic and educational backgrounds as well as low health literacy tend to be affected by the uncertainty, complexity, volatility, and progressiveness of public health crises and emergencies. A key lesson that governments have taken from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic is the importance of developing and disseminating highly accessible, actionable, inclusive, coherent public health advice, which represent a critical tool to help people with diverse cultural, educational backgrounds and varying abilities to effectively implement health policies at the grassroots level. Objective. We aimed to translate the best practices of accessible, inclusive public health advice (purposefully designed for people with low socioeconomic and educational background, health literacy levels, limited English proficiency, and cognitive/functional impairments) on COVID-19 from health authorities in English-speaking multicultural countries (USA, Australia, and UK) to adaptive tools for the evaluation of the accessibility of public health advice in other languages. Methods. We developed an optimised Bayesian classifier to produce probabilistic prediction of the accessibility of official health advice among vulnerable people including migrants and foreigners living in China. We developed an adaptive statistical formula for the rapid evaluation of the accessibility of health advice among vulnerable people in China. Results. Our study provides needed research tools to fill in a persistent gap in Chinese public health research on accessible, inclusive communication of infectious diseases' prevention and management. For the probabilistic prediction, using the optimised Bayesian machine learning classifier (GNB), the largest positive likelihood ratio (LR+) 16.685 (95% confidence interval: 4.35, 64.04) was identified when the probability threshold was set at 0.2 (sensitivity: 0.98; specificity: 0.94). Conclusion. Effective communication of health risks through accessible, inclusive, actionable public advice represents a powerful tool to reduce health inequalities amidst health crises and emergencies. Our study translated the best-practice public health advice developed during the pandemic into intuitive machine learning classifiers for health authorities to develop evidence-based guidelines of accessible health advice.

2021.0,treatment monitoring,Universiti Malaya,"Background Dengue fever is a widespread viral disease and one of the world's major pandemic vector-borne infections, causing serious hazard to humanity. The World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that the incidence of dengue fever has increased dramatically across the world in recent decades. WHO currently estimates an annual incidence of 50-100 million dengue infections worldwide. To date, no tested vaccine or treatment is available to stop or prevent dengue fever. Thus, the importance of predicting dengue outbreaks is significant. The current issue that should be addressed in dengue outbreak prediction is accuracy. A limited number of studies have conducted an in-depth analysis of climate factors in dengue outbreak prediction. Methods The most important climatic factors that contribute to dengue outbreaks were identified in the current work. Correlation analyses were performed in order to determine these factors and these factors were used as input parameters for machine learning models. Top five machine learning classification models (Bayes network (BN) models, support vector machine (SVM), RBF tree, decision table and naive Bayes) were chosen based on past research. The models were then tested and evaluated on the basis of 4-year data (January 2010 to December 2013) collected in Malaysia. Results This research has two major contributions. A new risk factor, called the TempeRain factor (TRF), was identified and used as an input parameter for the model of dengue outbreak prediction. Moreover, TRF was applied to demonstrate its strong impact on dengue outbreaks. Experimental results showed that the Bayes Network model with the new meteorological risk factor identified in this study increased accuracy to 92.35% for predicting dengue outbreaks. Conclusions This research explored the factors used in dengue outbreak prediction systems. The major contribution of this study is identifying new significant factors that contribute to dengue outbreak prediction.

Here, we investigate whether convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can also demonstrate effectiveness in classifying the environmental stages of parasites of public health importance and their invertebrate hosts. We used schistosomiasis as a reference model. Schistosomiasis is a debilitating parasitic disease transmitted to humans via snail intermediate hosts. The parasite affects more than 200 million people in tropical and subtropical regions. We trained our CNN, a feed-forward neural network, on a limited dataset of 5,500 images of snails and 5,100 images of cercariae obtained from schistosomiasis transmission sites in the Senegal River Basin, a region in western Africa that is hyper-endemic for the disease. The image set included both images of two snail genera that are relevant to schistosomiasis transmission - that is, Bulinus spp. and Biomphalaria pfeifferi - as well as snail images that are non-component hosts for human schistosomiasis. Cercariae shed from Bi. pfeifferi and Bulinus spp. snails were classified into 11 categories, of which only two, S. haematobium and S. mansoni, are major etiological agents of human schistosomiasis. The algorithms, trained on 80% of the snail and parasite dataset, achieved 99% and 91% accuracy for snail and parasite classification, respectively, when used on the hold-out validation dataset - a performance comparable to that of experienced parasitologists. The promising results of this proof-of-concept study suggests that this CNN model, and potentially similar replicable models, have the potential to support the classification of snails and parasite of medical importance. In remote field settings where machine learning algorithms can be deployed on cost-effective and widely used mobile devices, such as smartphones, these models can be a valuable complement to laboratory identification by trained technicians.

India and Brazil have reported the highest leprosy burden in the last few decades, revealing the need for strategies and tools to help health professionals correctly manage and control the disease. Objective: The main objective of this study was to develop a cross-platform app for leprosy screening based on artificial intelligence (AI) with the goal of increasing accessibility of an accurate method of classifying leprosy treatment for health professionals, especially for communities further away from major diagnostic centers. Toward this end, we analyzed the quality of leprosy data in Brazil on the National Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN). Methods: Leprosy data were extracted from the SINAN database, carefully cleaned, and used to build AI decision models based on the random forest algorithm to predict operational classification in paucibacillary or multibacillary leprosy. We used Python programming language to extract and clean the data, and R programming language to train and test the AI model via cross-validation. To allow broad access, we deployed the final random forest classification model in a web app via shinyApp using data available from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics and the Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System. Results: We mapped the dispersion of leprosy incidence in Brazil from 2014 to 2018, and found a particularly high number of cases in central Brazil in 2014 that further increased in 2018 in the state of Mato Grosso. For some municipalities, up to 80% of cases showed some data discrepancy. Of a total of 21,047 discrepancies detected, the most common was operational classification does not match the clinical form. After data processing, we identified a total of 77,628 cases with missing data. The sensitivity and specificity of the AI model applied for the operational classification of leprosy was 93.97% and 87.09%, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed app was able to recognize patterns in leprosy cases registered in the SINAN database and to classify new patients with paucibacillary or multibacillary leprosy, thereby reducing the probability of incorrect assignment by health centers. The collection and notification of data on leprosy in Brazil seem to lack specific validation to increase the quality of the data for implementations via AI.

We aimed to construct prognostic models using machine learning algorithms and to identify the most important predictors by utilising routinely available data under the government medical assistance programme. An established database of advanced schistosomiasis in Hunan, China was utilised for analysis. A total of 9541 patients for the period from January 2008 to December 2018 were enrolled in this study. Candidate predictors were selected from demographics, clinical features, medical examinations and test results. We applied five machine learning algorithms to construct 1 year prognostic models: logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). An area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the model perfor-mance. The important predictors of the optimal model for unfavourable prognosis within 1 year were identified and ranked. There were 1249 (13.1%) cases having unfavourable prognoses within 1 year of dis-charge. The mean age of all participants was 61.94 years, of whom 70.9% were male. In general, XGBoost showed the best predictive performance with the highest AUC (0.846; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.821, 0.871), compared with LR (0.798; 95% CI: 0.770, 0.827), DT (0.766; 95% CI: 0.733, 0.800), RF (0.823; 95% CI: 0.796, 0.851), and ANN (0.806; 95% CI: 0.778, 0.835).

Phenotypic screening has delivered thousands of promising hit compounds without prior knowledge of the compounds' exact target or MoA. Whilst the latter is not initially required to progress a compound in a medicinal chemistry program, identifying the MoA early can accelerate hit prioritization, hit-to-lead optimization and preclinical combination studies in malaria research. The effects of drug treatment on a cell can be observed on systems level in changes in the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are powerful tools able to deconvolute such complex chemically-induced transcriptional signatures to identify pathways on which a compound act and in this manner provide an indication of the MoA of a compound. In this study, we assessed different ML approaches for their ability to stratify antimalarial compounds based on varied chemically-induced transcriptional responses. We developed a rational gene selection approach that could identify predictive features for MoA to train and generate ML models. The best performing model could stratify compounds with similar MoA with a classification accuracy of 76.6 +/- 6.4%. Moreover, only a limited set of 50 biomarkers was required to stratify compounds with similar MoA and define chemo-transcriptomic fingerprints for each compound. These fingerprints were unique for each compound and compounds with similar targets/MoA clustered together. The ML model was specific and sensitive enough to group new compounds into MoAs associated with their predicted target and was robust enough to be extended to also generate chemo-transcriptomic fingerprints for additional life cycle stages like immature gametocytes.

Recent studies on automating this process have been conducted using artificial intelligence and feature selection of positional and morphological features from blood smear cell images using convolutional neural network (CNN). However, most deep CNN models do not perform well as per the expectation on small datasets. Approach: In this context, we propose a comprehensive computer-aided diagnosis scheme for automating the detection of malaria parasites in thin blood smear images using deep CNN, where transfer learning is used for optimizing the feature selection process. As an extra layer of security, layer embeddings are extracted from the intermediate convolutional layers using the feature matrix to cross-check the selection of features in the intermediate layers. The proposal includes the utilization of the ResNet 152 model integrated with the Deep Greedy Network for training, which produces an enhanced quality of prediction.

One of the drawbacks of this method is that its accuracy, consistency, and diagnosis speed depend on microscopists' diagnostic and technical skills. It is difficult to get highly skilled microscopists in remote areas of developing countries. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose to investigate state-of-the-art one-stage and two-stage object detection algorithms for automated malaria parasite screening from microscopic image of thick blood slides. Results YOLOV3 and YOLOV4 models, which are state-of-the-art object detectors in accuracy and speed, are not optimized for detecting small objects such as malaria parasites in microscopic images. We modify these models by increasing feature scale and adding more detection layers to enhance their capability of detecting small objects without notably decreasing detection speed. We propose one modified YOLOV4 model, called YOLOV4-MOD and two modified models of YOLOV3, which are called YOLOV3-MOD1 and YOLOV3-MOD2. Besides, new anchor box sizes are generated using K-means clustering algorithm to exploit the potential of these models in small object detection. The performance of the modified YOLOV3 and YOLOV4 models were evaluated on a publicly available malaria dataset. These models have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy by exceeding performance of their original versions, Faster R-CNN, and SSD in terms of mean average precision (mAP), recall, precision, F1 score, and average IOU.

Triatomine bugs act as vectors in the life cycle of the parasite and transmit infective parasite stages to animals and humans. Contact of the vector with T. cruzi alters its intestinal microbial composition, which may also affect the associated metabolic patterns of the insect. Earlier studies suggest that the complexity of the triatomine fecal metabolome may play a role in vector competence for different T. cruzi strains. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry and supervised machine learning, we aimed to detect differences in the intestinal metabolome of the triatomine Rhodnius prolixus and predict whether the insect had been exposed to T. cruzi or not based solely upon their metabolic profile. We were able to predict the exposure status of R. prolixus to T. cruzi with accuracies of 93.6%, 94.2% and 91.8% using logistic regression, a random forest classifier and a gradient boosting machine model, respectively.

The Kato-Katz technique is the diagnosis method recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) although it often presents a decreased sensitivity in low transmission settings and it is labour intensive. Visual reading of Kato-Katz preparations requires the samples to be analyzed in a short period of time since its preparation. Digitizing the samples could provide a solution which allows to store the samples in a digital database and perform remote analysis. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods based on digitized samples can support diagnosis by performing an objective and automatic quantification of disease infection. In this work, we propose an end-to-end pipeline for microscopy image digitization and automatic analysis of digitized images of STH. Our solution includes (a) a digitization system based on a mobile app that digitizes microscope samples using a 3D printed microscope adapter, (b) a telemedicine platform for remote analysis and labelling, and (c) novel deep learning algorithms for automatic assessment and quantification of parasitological infections by STH. The deep learning algorithm has been trained and tested on 51 slides of stool samples containing 949 Trichuris spp. eggs from 6 different subjects. The algorithm evaluation was performed using a cross-validation strategy, obtaining a mean precision of 98.44% and a mean recall of 80.94%. The results also proved the potential of generalization capability of the method at identifying different types of helminth eggs. Additionally, the AI-assisted quantification of STH based on digitized samples has been compared to the one performed using conventional microscopy, showing a good agreement between measurements. In conclusion, this work has presented a comprehensive pipeline using smartphone-assisted microscopy. It is integrated with a telemedicine platform for automatic image analysis and quantification of STH infection using AI models. Author summarySoil-transmitted helminths (STH), including hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura, are common intestinal infections in low-income countries. Global estimates indicate that more than 1.5 billion people are infected with at least one STH species. They cause anaemia, gastro-intestinal problems, tiredness amongst other symptoms. Diagnosis of STH infection is mainly performed by analyzing stool samples under the microscope using the so-called Kato-Katz technique. However, the analysis of Kato-Katz samples, which is usually performed by microscopy experts, is a subjective procedure based on visual inspection of the samples and requires to be done in a short period of time since the sample preparation.

2021.0,diagnosis,University of Pavia; Victoria University Wellington; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Mosquitoes propagate many human diseases, some widespread and with no vaccines. The Ae. aegypti mosquito vector transmits Zika, Chikungunya, and Dengue viruses. Effective public health interventions to control the spread of these diseases and protect the population require models that explain the core environmental drivers of the vector population. Field campaigns are expensive, and data from meteorological sites that feed models with the required environmental data often lack detail. As a consequence, we explore temporal modeling of the population of Ae. aegypti mosquito vector species and environmental conditions- temperature, moisture, precipitation, and vegetation- have been shown to have significant effects. We use earth observation (EO) data as our source for estimating these biotic and abiotic environmental variables based on proxy features, namely: Normalized difference vegetation index, Normalized difference water index, Precipitation, and Land surface temperature. We obtained our response variable from field-collected mosquito population measured weekly using 791 mosquito traps in Vila Velha city, Brazil, for 36 weeks in 2017, and 40 weeks in 2018. Recent similar studies have used machine learning (ML) techniques for this task. However, these techniques are neither intuitive nor explainable from an operational point of view. As a result, we use a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to model this relationship due to its fitness for count response variable modeling, its interpretability, and the ability to visualize the confidence intervals for all inferences. Also, to improve our model, we use the Akaike Information Criterion to select the most informative environmental features. Finally, we show how to improve the quality of the model by weighting our GLM. Our resulting weighted GLM compares well in quality with ML techniques: Random Forest and Support Vector Machines.

2021.0,diagnosis,"University of London; University College London; National Physical Laboratory - UK; University of Ibadan; University College Hospital, Ibadan; University of Strathclyde","Automated image-based assessment of blood films has tremendous potential to support clinical haematology within overstretched healthcare systems. To achieve this, efficient and reliable digital capture of the rich diagnostic information contained within a blood film is a critical first step. However, this is often challenging, and in many cases entirely unfeasible, with the microscopes typically used in haematology due to the fundamental trade-off between magnification and spatial resolution. To address this, we investigated three state-of-the-art approaches to microscopic imaging of blood films which leverage recent advances in optical and computational imaging and analysis to increase the information capture capacity of the optical microscope: optical mesoscopy, which uses a giant microscope objective (Mesolens) to enable high-resolution imaging at low magnification; Fourier ptychographic microscopy, a computational imaging method which relies on oblique illumination with a series of LEDs to capture high-resolution information; and deep neural networks which can be trained to increase the quality of low magnification, low resolution images. We compare and contrast the performance of these techniques for blood film imaging for the exemplar case of Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smears. Using computational image analysis and shape-based object classification, we demonstrate their use for automated analysis of red blood cell morphology and visualization and detection of small blood-borne parasites such as the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Our results demonstrate that these new methods greatly increase the information capturing capacity of the light microscope, with transformative potential for haematology and more generally across digital pathology.

Their in vitro leishmanicidal activity against visceral (L. donovani) and cutaneous (L. amazonensis) leishmaniasis was evaluated. The best activity was found, in general, for the 10-arylmethyl substituted pyrroloisoquinolines. In particular, 2ad (IC50 = 3.30 mu M, SI > 77.01) and 2bb (IC50 = 3.93 mu M, SI > 58.77) were approximately 10-fold more potent and selective than the drug of reference (miltefosine), against L. amazonensis on in vitro promastigote assays, while 2ae was the more active compound in the in vitro amastigote assays (IC50 = 33.59 mu M, SI > 8.93). Notably, almost all compounds showed low cytotoxicity, CC50 > 100 mu g/mL in J774 cells, highest tested dose. In addition, we have developed the first Perturbation Theory Machine Learning (PTML) algorithm able to predict simultaneously multiple biological activity parameters (IC50, K-i, etc.) vs. any Leishmania species and target protein, with high values of specificity (>98%) and sensitivity (>90%) in both training and validation series.

The aetiology is usually bacterial or viral, but malaria can cause a syndrome indistinguishable from clinical pneumonia. There is no method with high sensitivity to detect a bacterial infection in these patients and, as result, antibiotics are frequently overprescribed. Conversely, unrecognised concomitant bacterial infection in patients with malarial infections occur with omission of antibiotic therapy from patients with bacterial infections. Previously, we identified two combinations of blood proteins with 96% sensitivity and 86% specificity for detecting bacterial disease. The current project aimed to validate and improve these combinations by evaluating additional biomarkers in paediatric patients with clinical pneumonia. Our goal was to describe combinations of a limited number of proteins with high sensitivity and specificity for bacterial infection to be incorporated in future point-of-care tests. Furthermore, we seek to explore signatures to prognosticate clinical pneumonia. Methods and analysis Patients (n=900) aged 2-59 months presenting with clinical pneumonia at two Gambian hospitals will be enrolled and classified according to criteria for definitive bacterial aetiology (based on microbiological tests and chest radiographs). We will measure proteins at admission using Luminex-based immunoassays in 90 children with definitive and 160 with probable bacterial aetiology, and 160 children classified according to the prognosis of their disease. Previously identified diagnostic signatures will be assessed through accuracy measures.

We also aimed to identify the spatial distribution patterns of positive cases. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with a questionnaire about clinical symptoms, socioeconomic and demographic factors, and a 10 ml blood sample was collected and analysed by ELISA. For the bivariate analysis, we use the chi-square test, a prevalence ratio and its 95% confidence interval. A robust Poisson hierarchical regression was used to adjust for confounders. The Kernel density was performed for the spatial analysis. A total of 409 samples were analysed; of them, 70.7% were seropositive for previous exposure to chikungunya virus (CHIKV). High seropositivity for CHIKV was higher in female participants (75.5%; PR = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.06-1.43), those aged 31 years or more (74.3%; PR = 1.62; 95% CI: 1.04-2.52), and those with elementary education level (75.0%; PR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.06-1.60). There were also high seroprevalence in those with less than a minimum wage per month (89.5%; PR = 1.59; 95% CI: 1.11-2.30), housewives (87.5%; PR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.24-2.18) and unemployed (80.0%; PR = 1.50; 95% CI: 1.10-2.06).

Schistosomiasis exerts large health, social and financial burdens on infected individuals and households. While irrigation schemes are one of the most important policy responses designed to reduce poverty, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, they facilitate the propagation of schistosomiasis and other diseases. Methods: We estimate the economic impact of schistosomiasis in Burkina Faso via its effect on agricultural production. We create an original dataset that combines detailed household and agricultural surveys with high-resolution geo-statistical disease maps. We develop new methods that use the densities of the intermediate host snails of schistosomiasis as instrumental variables together with panel, spatial and machine learning techniques. Results: We estimate that the elimination of schistosomiasis in Burkina Faso would increase average crop yields by around 7%, rising to 32% for high infection clusters. Keeping schistosomiasis unchecked, in turn, would correspond to a loss of gross domestic product of approximately 0.8%. We identify the disease burden as a shock to the agricultural productivity of farmers. The poorest households engaged in subsistence agriculture bear a far heavier disease burden than their wealthier counterparts, experiencing an average yield loss due to schistosomiasis of between 32 and 45%. We show that the returns to water resources development are substantially reduced once its health effects are taken into account: villages in proximity of large-scale dams suffer an average yield loss of around 20%, and this burden decreases as distance between dams and villages increases. Conclusions: This study provides a rigorous estimation of how schistosomiasis affects agricultural production and how it is both a driver and a consequence of poverty. It further quantifies the tradeoff between the economics of water infrastructures and their impact on public health.

The diagnostic gold standard for onchocerciasis relies on identification and enumeration of (skin-dwelling) Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae (mf) using the skin snip technique (SST). In a recent study, blood-borne Loa loa mf were found by SST in individuals heavily infected with L. loa, and microscopically misidentified as O. volvulus due to their superficially similar morphology. This study investigates the relationship between L. loa microfilarial density (Loa MFD) and the probability of testing SST positive. Methods. A total of 1053 participants from the (onchocerciasis and loiasis coendemic) East Region in Cameroon were tested for (1) Loa MFD in blood samples, (2) O. volvulus presence by SST, and (3) Immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 antibody positivity to Ov16 by rapid diagnostic test (RDT). A Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model was used to perform a supervised classification of SST status and identify a Loa MFD threshold above which it is highly likely to find L. loa mf in skin snips. Results. Of 1011 Ov16-negative individuals, 28 (2.8%) tested SST positive and 150 (14.8%) were L. loa positive. The range of Loa MFD was 0-85 200 mf/mL.

To assist an understanding of malaria pathogenesis, including drug resistance, there is a need for the timely detection of underlying genetic mutations and their spread. With the increasing use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of Plasmodium DNA, the potential of deep learning models to detect loci under recent positive selection, historically signals of drug resistance, was evaluated. Methods: A deep learning-based approach (called DeepSweep) was developed, which can be trained on haplotypic images from genetic regions with known sweeps, to identify loci under positive selection. DeepSweep software is available from . Results: Using simulated genomic data, DeepSweep could detect recent sweeps with high predictive accuracy (areas under ROC curve > 0.95). DeepSweep was applied to Plasmodium falciparum (n = 1125; genome size 23 Mbp) and Plasmodium vivax (n = 368; genome size 29 Mbp) WGS data, and the genes identified overlapped with two established extended haplotype homozygosity methods (within-population iHS, across-population Rsb) (similar to 60-75% overlap of hits at P < 0.0001). DeepSweep hits included regions proximal to known drug resistance loci for both P. falciparum (e.g. pfcrt, pfdhps and pfmdr1) and P. vivax (e.g. pvmrp1). Conclusion: The deep learning approach can detect positive selection signatures in malaria parasite WGS data.

The clinical picture ranges from undifferentiated fever to more severe forms such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Compared to healthy controls, we explored the likelihood of having vitamin D deficiency (VDD) among children with severe dengue infection. Methods. This case-control study compared hospitalized children (2 months to 12 years) with DHF and DSS with radiologically confirmed plasma leak with age-matched healthy controls. The association of 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] level, age, sex, and socioeconomic status with DHF/DSS was assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results. Forty children with DHF/DSS were compared with 52 healthy controls. Mean (SD) age was 8.8 (2.9) years and 7.9 (3.7) years among cases and controls, respectively. Most (n = 28, 70%) had DHF. In multivariate logistic regression, the likelihood of having VDD [25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL] was 3.6 times higher in cases compared to controls (Odds Ratio (OR): 3.65, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.461, 9.102, p=0.006). When serum 25(OH)D was used as a continuous independent variable, the strength of the association between DHF/DSS and serum 25(OH)D was weak but statistically significant; the likelihood of having DHF/DSS is 0.94 times less with 1 ng/mL increase in serum 25(OH)D (OR: 0.940, 95% CI: 0.887, 0.995, p=0.03). Conclusion. The present study suggests that the likelihood of having VDD among children with DHF/DSS is higher than that in their healthy counterparts. Thus, further studies are critical in confirming whether vitamin D repletion is beneficial in preventing severe forms of dengue in the quest to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with dengue infection.",VIRUS,"University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka [ASP/01/RE/MED/2019/53]",Vitamin D Deficiency in Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever and Dengue Shock Syndrome among Sri Lankan Children: A Case-Control Study,NO

In particular, they are an important tool to track the spread of drug resistance and to validate genetic makers of drug resistance. To make sense of parasite genetic data, researchers usually characterise the population structure using statistical methods. This is most often done as a two step process. The first is a data reduction step, whereby the data are summarised into a distance matrix (each entry represents the genetic distance between two isolates). The distance matrix is then input into an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Principal coordinates analysis and hierarchical agglomerative clustering are the two most popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms used for this purpose in malaria genetic epidemiology. We highlight that this procedure is sensitive to the choice of genetic distance and to the specification of the algorithms. These unsupervised methods are useful for exploratory data analysis but cannot be used to infer historical events. We provide some guidance on how to make genetic epidemiology analyses more transparent and reproducible. Genetic surveillance of malaria parasites supports malaria control programmes, treatment guidelines and elimination strategies. Surveillance studies often pose questions about malaria parasite ancestry (e.g. how antimalarial resistance has spread) and employ statistical methods that characterise parasite population structure. Many of the methods used to characterise structure are unsupervised machine learning algorithms which depend on a genetic distance matrix, notably principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC). PCoA and HAC are sensitive to both the definition of genetic distance and algorithmic specification. Importantly, neither algorithm infers malaria parasite ancestry. As such, PCoA and HAC can inform (e.g. via exploratory data visualisation and hypothesis generation), but not answer comprehensively, key questions about malaria parasite ancestry. We illustrate the sensitivity of PCoA and HAC using 393Plasmodium falciparumwhole genome sequences collected from Cambodia and neighbouring regions (where antimalarial resistance has emerged and spread recently) and we provide tentative guidance for the use and interpretation of PCoA and HAC in malaria parasite genetic epidemiology. This guidance includes a call for fully transparent and reproducible analysis pipelines that feature (i) a clearly outlined scientific question; (ii) a clear justification of analytical methods used to answer the scientific question along with discussion of any inferential limitations; (iii) publicly available genetic distance matrices when downstream analyses depend on them; and (iv) sensitivity analyses. To bridge the inferential disconnect between the output of non-inferential unsupervised learning algorithms and the scientific questions of interest, tailor-made statistical models are needed to infer malaria parasite ancestry.

Current cell-based drug screens are, however, restricted to binary live/dead readouts with no provision for mechanism of action prediction. Machine learning methods are increasingly being used to improve information extraction from imaging data. These methods, however, work poorly with heterogeneous cellular phenotypes and generally require time-consuming human-led training. We have developed a semi-supervised machine learning approach, combining human- and machine- labeled training data from mixed human malaria parasite cultures. Designed for high-throughput and high-resolution screening, our semi-supervised approach is robust to natural parasite morphological heterogeneity and correctly orders parasite developmental stages.

The emerging technologies of machine learning that can learn complex image patterns have accelerated research in medical image analysis. In this study, on a dataset of thick blood smear images, we evaluate and compare performance of three pre-trained deep learning architectures namely; faster regional convolutional neural network (faster R-CNN), single-shot multi-box detector (SSD) and RetinaNet through a Tensorflow object detection API. Data augmentation method was applied to optimise performance of the meta architectures. The possibility for mobile phone detector deployment was also investigated. The results revealed that faster R-CNN was the best trained model with a mean average precision of over 0.94 and SSD, was the best model for mobile deployment.

The key to surviving this disease is its early diagnosis. However, manual diagnosis is time consuming and tedious due to the large amount of image data. Generally, computer-aided diagnosis can effectively improve doctors' perception and accuracy. This paper presents a medical diagnosis method powered by convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from images and improve early detection of malaria. The image sharpening and histogram equalization method are used aiming at enlarging the difference between parasitized regions and other area. Dropout technology is employed in every convolutional layer to reduce overfitting in the network, which is proved to be effective. The proposed CNN model achieves a significant performance with the best classification accuracy of 99.98%. Moreover, this paper compares the proposed model with the pretrained CNNs and other traditional algorithms. The results indicate the proposed model can achieve state-of-the-art performance from multiple metrics.

The invention of antibiotics and vaccines in the past century has notably increased the survival rate of Pneumonia patients. Currently, the primary challenge is to detect the disease at an early stage and determine its type to initiate the appropriate treatment. Usually, a trained physician or a radiologist undertakes the task of diagnosing Pneumonia by examining the patient's chest X-ray. However, the number of such trained individuals is nominal when compared to the 450 million people who get affected by Pneumonia every year. Fortunately, this challenge can be met by introducing modern computers and improved Machine Learning techniques in Pneumonia diagnosis. Researchers have been trying to develop a method to automatically detect Pneumonia using machines by analyzing and the symptoms of the disease and chest radiographic images of the patients for the past two decades. However, with the development of cogent Deep Learning algorithms, the formation of such an automatic system is very much within the realms of possibility.

Question Can deep learning be used to develop an automated malaria detection algorithm? Findings In this diagnostic study that used a 1-stage deep learning framework and benchmark data sets, the malaria detection algorithm achieved expert-level performance in detecting Plasmodium falciparum in thin blood smear images. The comparable performance between the algorithm and human experts was confirmed by a clinical validation study at the cell level and the image level. Meaning The findings suggest that a clinically validated expert-level malaria detection algorithm could be used to accelerate the development of clinically applicable automated malaria diagnostics. Importance Decades of effort have been devoted to establishing an automated microscopic diagnosis of malaria, but there are challenges in achieving expert-level performance in real-world clinical settings because publicly available annotated data for benchmark and validation are required. Objective To assess an expert-level malaria detection algorithm using a publicly available benchmark image data set. Design, Setting, and Participants In this diagnostic study, clinically validated malaria image data sets, the Taiwan Images for Malaria Eradication (TIME), were created by digitizing thin blood smears acquired from patients with malaria selected from the biobank of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2018. These smear images were annotated by 4 clinical laboratory scientists who worked in medical centers in Taiwan and trained for malaria microscopic diagnosis at the national reference laboratory of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. With TIME, a convolutional neural network-based object detection algorithm was developed for identification of malaria-infected red blood cells. A diagnostic challenge using another independent data set within TIME was performed to compare the algorithm performance against that of human experts as clinical validation. Main Outcomes and Measures Performance on detecting Plasmodium falciparum-infected blood cells was measured by average precision, and performance on detecting P falciparum infection at the image level was measured using sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results The TIME data sets contained 8145 images of 36 blood smears from patients with suspected malaria (30 P falciparum-positive and 6 P falciparum-negative smears) that had reliable annotations. For clinical validation, the average precision was 0.885 for detecting P falciparum-infected blood cells and 0.838 for ring form. For detecting P falciparum infection on blood smear images, the algorithm had expert-level performance (sensitivity, 0.995; specificity, 0.900; AUC, 0.997 [95% CI, 0.993-0.999]), especially in detecting ring form (sensitivity, 0.968; specificity, 0.960; AUC, 0.995 [95% CI, 0.990-0.998]) compared with experienced microscopists (mean sensitivity, 0.995 [95% CI, 0.993-0.998]; mean specificity, 0.955 [95% CI, 0.885-1.000]).

With 154 species described in the world, the correct determination of the species involved in the transmission is crucial to develop efficient control strategies. This can be achieved by taxonomic keys (available only for adult stages, nymphal instars must be reared), or by molecular techniques. Both are time and/or money consuming, showing the needs of new identification tools, especially for nymphal instars which are the most frequently found on the field. Visible and near-infrared spectroscopy (VIS-NIR), used successfully these last years in various organisms' determination, was applied on a sample of three species from Bolivia: Triatoma infestans, Triatoma sordida and Triatoma guasayana. The spectrum of the dorsal part of the head from nymphal instars and adult stages was taken for each specimen of each species. Different methods of preprocessing and selection of variables (wavelengths) were tested to find the best model of classification for the three species. Each model was evaluated by different indices: accuracy, specificity, and F1 score. The comparison of the performance of each model evidenced that the best results were obtained when using a short spectrum (400-2000 nm) without pre-processing. A total of 32 components were retained by tuning, and 933 wavelengths were kept by the backward feature selection algorithm. Applying it on a new sample of insects, this model showed a global accuracy of 97.2% (95.0-98.6). The F1 score was greater than 0.95, and the specificity greater than 0.94 for all the species.

CHIKV causes a severe and debilitating disease with high morbidity. The first Colombian autochthonous case was reported in the Colombian Caribbean region in September 2014. Within the next two to three months, the CHIKV outbreak reached its peak. Although the CHIKV pattern of clinical symptomatology has been documented in different epidemiological studies, understanding of the relationship between clinical symptomatology and variation in phenotypic response to CHIKV infection in humans remains limited. We performed a cross sectional study following 1160 individuals clinically diagnosed with CHIKV at the peak of the Chikungunya outbreak in the Colombian Caribbean region. We examined the relationship between symptomatology and diverse phenotypic responses. Latent Class Cluster Analysis (LCCA) models were used to characterize patients' symptomatology and further identify subgroups of individuals with differential phenotypic response. We found that most individuals presented fever (94.4%), headache (73.28%) and general discomfort (59.4%), which are distinct clinical symptoms of a viral infection. Furthermore, 11/26 (43.2%) of the categorized symptoms were more frequent in women than in men. LCCA disclosed seven distinctive phenotypic response profiles in this population of CHIKV infected individuals. Interestingly, 282 (24.3%) individuals exhibited a lower symptomatic extreme phenotype and 74 (6.4%) patients were within the severe complex extreme phenotype. Although clinical symptomatology may be diverse, there are distinct symptoms or group of symptoms that can be correlated with differential phenotypic response and perhaps susceptibility to CHIKV infection, especially in the female population. This suggests that, comparatively to men, women are a CHIKV at-risk population. Further study is needed to validate these results and determine whether the distinct LCCA profiles are a result of the immune response or a mixture of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors. Our findings could contribute to the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches to characterizing CHIKV infection in other populations. Preliminary results show that the accuracy reached of some approaches reaches up to 92% overall, with substantial sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values per LCCA-derived cluster. Author summary The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection is a mosquito-borne virus of the Togaviridae family, part of the arbovirus group of mosquito-transmitted pathogens. CHIKV causes a severe and debilitating disease with high morbidity. In this study, we comprehensively analysed clinical data from 1160 individuals from the Colombian Caribbean, who were diagnosed with CHIKV infection during the 2014 epidemic peak and before the Zika epidemic (registered back in 2015). Further, the presence of latent classes and predictors of CHIKV susceptibility and severity of the CHIKV infection were analysed. Although it is well known that people respond differently to infection, our results showed that these differences are not arbitrary and may come from the specific orchestration of our immune response and specific genetic makeup. For example, we identified that females infected with CHIKV exhibited significant and heterogeneous phenotypic response patterns compared to men. Overall, these results inform about potential predictors and outlining strategies to study the natural history of CHIKV infection. Future studies assessing the contribution of demographic, immunological and genetic factors to symptom co-occurrence could shed some light on the severity of the clinical symptomatology and, ultimately, lead to more accurate, more efficient and differential diagnosis. These results could contribute to the development of machine learning approaches to characterizing CHIKV infection in other populations and provide more accurate and differential diagnosis.",ROSS-RIVER-VIRUS; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; CELLULAR ASPECTS; EPIDEMIC; DISEASE; ARTHRITIS; FEVER,,Chikungunya outbreak (2015) in the Colombian Caribbean: Latent classes and gender differences in virus infection,YES

Rapid diagnosis and subsequent treatment are the most effective means to mitigate the progression into serious symptoms.

Methods: We have developed the first deep learning method that can detect malaria parasites in thick blood smear images and can run on smartphones. Our method consists of two processing steps. First, we apply an intensity-based Iterative Global Minimum Screening (IGMS), which performs a fast screening of a thick smear image to find parasite candidates. Then, a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifies each candidate as either parasite or background. Together with this paper, we make a dataset of 1819 thick smear images from 150 patients publicly available to the research community. We used this dataset to train and test our deep learning method, as described in this paper. Results: A patient-level five-fold cross-evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the customized CNN model in discriminating between positive (parasitic) and negative image patches in terms of the following performance indicators: accuracy (93.46% +/- 0.32%), AUC (98.39% +/- 0.18%), sensitivity (92.59% +/- 1.27%), specificity (94.33% +/- 1.25%), precision (94.25% +/- 1.13%), and negative predictive value (92.74% +/- 1.09%).

Due to the constant emergence of parasitic resistance to the current antimalarial drugs, the discovery of new drug candidates is a major global health priority. Aiming to make the drug discovery processes faster and less expensive, we developed binary and continuous Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) models implementing deep learning for predicting antiplasmodial activity and cytotoxicity of untested compounds. Then, we applied the best models for a virtual screening of a large database of chemical compounds. The top computational predictions were evaluated experimentally against asexual blood stages of both sensitive and multi-drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains. Among them, two compounds, LabMol-149 and LabMol-152, showed potent antiplasmodial activity at low nanomolar concentrations (EC50 < 500 nM) and low cytotoxicity in mammalian cells.

2020.0,drug discovery,State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida,"Antimalarial drugs are becoming less effective due to the emergence of drug resistance. Resistance has been reported for all available malaria drugs, including artemisinin, thus creating a perpetual need for alternative drug candidates. The traditional drug discovery approach of high throughput screening (HTS) of large compound libraries for identification of new drug leads is time-consuming and resource intensive. While virtual in silico screening is a solution to this problem, however, the generalization of the models is not ideal. Artificial intelligence (AI), utilizing either structure-based or ligand-based approaches, has demonstrated highly accurate performances in the field of chemical property prediction. Leveraging the existing data, AI would be a suitable alternative to blind-search HTS or fingerprint-based virtual screening. The AI model would learn patterns within the data and help to search for hit compounds efficiently. In this work, we introduce DeepMalaria, a deep-learning based process capable of predicting the anti-Plasmodium falciparum inhibitory properties of compounds using their SMILES. A graph-based model is trained on 13,446 publicly available antiplasmodial hit compounds from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) dataset that are currently being used to find novel drug candidates for malaria. We validated this model by predicting hit compounds from a macrocyclic compound library and already approved drugs that are used for repurposing. We have chosen macrocyclic compounds as these ligand-binding structures are underexplored in malaria drug discovery. The in silico pipeline for this process also consists of additional validation of an in-house independent dataset consisting mostly of natural product compounds. Transfer learning from a large dataset was leveraged to improve the performance of the deep learning model. To validate the DeepMalaria generated hits, we used a commonly used SYBR Green I fluorescence assay based phenotypic screening. DeepMalaria was able to detect all the compounds with nanomolar activity and 87.5% of the compounds with greater than 50% inhibition. Further experiments to reveal the compounds' mechanism of action have shown that not only does one of the hit compounds, DC-9237, inhibits all asexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum, but is a fast-acting compound which makes it a strong candidate for further optimization.",NATURAL-PRODUCTS; DRUG DISCOVERY; MACROCYCLES; ASSAY,"(University of Central Florida, College of Medicine)",DeepMalaria: Artificial Intelligence Driven Discovery of Potent Antiplasmodials,YES

Visual identification of mosquito species is the foundation of mosquito-borne disease surveillance and management, but can be hindered by cryptic morphological variation in mosquito vector species complexes such as the malaria-transmitting Anopheles gambiae complex. We sought to apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to images of mosquitoes as a proof-of-concept to determine the feasibility of automatic classification of mosquito sex, genus, species, and strains using whole-body, 2D images of mosquitoes. We introduce a library of 1, 709 images of adult mosquitoes collected from 16 colonies of mosquito vector species and strains originating from five geographic regions, with 4 cryptic species not readily distinguishable morphologically even by trained medical entomologists. We present a methodology for image processing, data augmentation, and training and validation of a CNN. Our best CNN configuration achieved high prediction accuracies of 96.96% for species identification and 98.48% for sex. Our results demonstrate that CNNs can delimit species with cryptic morphological variation, 2 strains of a single species, and specimens from a single colony stored using two different methods. We present visualizations of the CNN feature space and predictions for interpretation of our results, and we further discuss applications of our findings for future applications in malaria mosquito surveillance. Author summary Rapid and accurate identification of mosquitoes that transmit human pathogens is an essential part of mosquito-borne disease surveillance. Such identification can be difficult for mosquitoes that transmit malaria, as many are morphologically indistinguishable, including those in the Anopheles gambiae species complex. We photographed 1, 709 individual mosquitoes from 16 laboratory colonies housed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to create a database of whole-body mosquito images. We present a methodology for image processing, data augmentation, and training and validation of a convolutional neural network (CNN). We applied this method to our mosquito image database, finding a 96.96% prediction accuracy for class identification and 98.48% for sex. Further, our best model accurately predicted images between 2 strains of a single species and between 2 storage methods of mosquitoes from the same colony.

Dengue forecasting is essential for enhancing the effectiveness of preventive measures. Current studies have been primarily conducted at national, sub-national, and city levels, while an intra-urban dengue forecasting at a fine spatial resolution still remains a challenging feat. As viruses spread rapidly because of a highly dynamic population flow, integrating spatial interactions of human movements between regions would be potentially beneficial for intra-urban dengue forecasting. Methodology In this study, a new framework for enhancing intra-urban dengue forecasting was developed by integrating the spatial interactions between urban regions. First, a graph-embedding technique called Node2Vec was employed to learn the embeddings (in the form of an N-dimensional real-valued vector) of the regions from their population flow network. As strongly interacting regions would have more similar embeddings, the embeddings can serve as interaction features. Then, the interaction features were combined with those commonly used features (e.g., temperature, rainfall, and population) to enhance the supervised learning-based dengue forecasting models at a fine-grained intra-urban scale. Results The performance of forecasting models (i.e., SVM, LASSO, and ANN) integrated with and without interaction features is tested and compared on township level dengue forecasting in Guangzhou, the most dengue threatened sub-tropical city in China. Results show that models using both common and interaction features can achieve better performance than that using common features alone. Conclusions The proposed approach for incorporating spatial interactions of human movements using graph-embedding technique is effective, which can help enhance fine-grained intra-urban dengue forecasting. Author summary Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne infectious disease, has become a serious public health problem in many tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, such as Southeast Asian countries and the Guangdong Province in China. In the absence of an effective vaccine at present, disease surveillance and mosquito control remain the primary means of controlling the spread of the disease. At an intra-urban setting, it is important to predict the spatial distribution of future patients, which can help government agencies to establish precise and targeted prevention measures beforehand. Considering the fast virus spread within a city because of a highly dynamic population flow, we propose a novel approach to enhancing fine-grained intra-urban dengue forecasting by integrating spatial interactions of human movements between urban regions. First, using a graph-embedding model called Node2Vec, the embeddings of the regions were learned from their population interaction network so that strongly interacted regions would have more similar embeddings. Secondly, serving as interaction features, the embeddings are combined with the commonly used features as inputs of the forecasting models. The results indicate that the performance of the models can be improved by incorporating the interaction features, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed strategy in enhancing fine-grained intra-urban dengue forecasting.",HUMAN MOBILITY; TRANSMISSION; FEVER,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41901391]; Shenzhen Basic Research Program [JCYJ20190807163001783]; Joint Engineering Research Center for Health Big Data Intelligent Analysis Technology,Enhancing fine-grained intra-urban dengue forecasting by integrating spatial interactions of human movements between urban regions,YES

The disease then rapidly spread to other countries in Americas and East Asia, affecting more than 1,000,000 people. Zika virus is primarily transmitted through bites of infected mosquitoes of the species Aedes (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus). The abundance of mosquitoes and, as a result, the prevalence of Zika virus infections are common in areas which have high precipitation, high temperature, and high population density. Nonlinear spatio-temporal dependency of such data and lack of historical public health records make prediction of the virus spread particularly challenging. In this article, we enhance Zika forecasting by introducing the concepts of topological data analysis and, specifically, persistent homology of atmospheric variables, into the virus spread modeling. The topological summaries allow for capturing higher order dependencies among atmospheric variables that otherwise might be unassessable via conventional spatio-temporal modeling approaches based on geographical proximity assessed via Euclidean distance. We introduce a new concept of cumulative Betti numbers and then integrate the cumulative Betti numbers as topological descriptors into three predictive machine learning models: random forest, generalized boosted regression, and deep neural network. Furthermore, to better quantify for various sources of uncertainties, we combine the resulting individual model forecasts into an ensemble of the Zika spread predictions using Bayesian model averaging.

Accurate malaria diagnosis remains a challenge. Automated imaging processing approaches to analyze Thick Blood Films (TBF) could provide scalable solutions, for urban healthcare providers in the holoendemic malaria sub-Saharan region. Although several approaches have been attempted to identify malaria parasites in TBF, none have achieved negative and positive predictive performance suitable for clinical use in the west sub-Saharan region. While malaria parasite object detection remains an intermediary step in achieving automatic patient diagnosis, training state-of-the-art deep-learning object detectors requires the human-expert labor-intensive process of labeling a large dataset of digitized TBF. To overcome these challenges and to achieve a clinically usable system, we show a novel approach. It leverages routine clinical-microscopy labels from our quality-controlled malaria clinics, to train a Deep Malaria Convolutional Neural Network classifier (DeepMCNN) for automated malaria diagnosis. Our system also provides total Malaria Parasite (MP) and White Blood Cell (WBC) counts allowing parasitemia estimation in MP/mu L, as recommended by the WHO.

Accurately distinguishing malaria from other diseases, especially uncomplicated malaria (UM) from non-malarial infections (nMI), remains a challenge. Furthermore, the success of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) is threatened by Pfhrp2/3 deletions and decreased sensitivity at low parasitaemia. Analysis of haematological indices can be used to support the identification of possible malaria cases for further diagnosis, especially in travellers returning from endemic areas. As a new application for precision medicine, we aimed to evaluate machine learning (ML) approaches that can accurately classify nMI, UM, and severe malaria (SM) using haematological parameters. Methods We obtained haematological data from 2,207 participants collected in Ghana: nMI (n = 978), SM (n = 526), and UM (n = 703). Six different ML approaches were tested, to select the best approach. An artificial neural network (ANN) with three hidden layers was used for multi-classification of UM, SM, and uMI. Binary classifiers were developed to further identify the parameters that can distinguish UM or SM from nMI. Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) were used to explain the binary classifiers. Results The multi-classification model had greater than 85% training and testing accuracy to distinguish clinical malaria from nMI. To distinguish UM from nMI, our approach identified platelet counts, red blood cell (RBC) counts, lymphocyte counts, and percentages as the top classifiers of UM with 0.801 test accuracy (AUC = 0.866 and F1 score = 0.747). To distinguish SM from nMI, the classifier had a test accuracy of 0.96 (AUC = 0.983 and F1 score = 0.944) with mean platelet volume and mean cell volume being the unique classifiers of SM. Random forest was used to confirm the classifications, and it showed that platelet and RBC counts were the major classifiers of UM, regardless of possible confounders such as patient age and sampling location. Conclusion The study provides proof of concept methods that classify UM and SM from nMI, showing that the ML approach is a feasible tool for clinical decision support.

Humans have always been in the quest to find strategies to avoid diseases that are life-threatening or affect the quality of life of humans. Effective use of resources available to human to control different diseases has always been critical. Researchers are recently more interested to find AI-based solutions to control the human population from diseases due to the overwhelming popularity of deep learning. There are many supervised techniques that have always been applied for disease diagnosis. However, the main problem of supervised based solutions is the availability of data, which is not always possible or not always complete. For instance, we do not have enough data that shows the different states of humans and different states of environments, and how all different actions taken by humans or viruses have ultimately resulted in a disease that eventually takes the lives of humans. Therefore, there is a need to find unsupervised based solutions or some techniques that do not have a dependency on the underlying dataset. In this paper, we have explored the reinforcement learning approach. We have tried different reinforcement learning algorithms to research different solutions for the prevention of diseases in the simulation of the human population. We have explored different techniques for controlling the transmission of diseases and its effects on health in the human population simulated in an environment.

Most healthcare-based disease surveillance systems, however, have significant inherent reporting delays due to data collection, aggregation, and distribution processes. Recent work has shown that machine learning methods leveraging a combination of traditionally collected epidemiological information and novel Internet-based data sources, such as disease-related Internet search activity, can produce meaningful nowcasts of disease incidence ahead of healthcare-based estimates, with most successful case studies focusing on endemic and seasonal diseases such as influenza and dengue. Here, we apply similar computational methods to emerging outbreaks in geographic regions where no historical presence of the disease of interest has been observed. By combining limited available historical epidemiological data available with disease-related Internet search activity, we retrospectively estimate disease activity in five recent outbreaks weeks ahead of traditional surveillance methods. We find that the proposed computational methods frequently provide useful real-time incidence estimates that can help fill temporal data gaps resulting from surveillance reporting delays. However, the proposed methods are limited by issues of sample bias and skew in search query volumes, perhaps as a result of media coverage. Author summary Public health officials regularly make choices about treatment and prevention in disease outbreaks that have the potential to impact entire affected populations. Often these decisions are based on incomplete or unreliable information due to inherent reporting delays in healthcare-based disease surveillance systems. This issue of public health decision-making based on limited data is even more salient in emerging outbreaks, which are typically characterized by uncertain disease dynamics and limited surveillance capacity. We demonstrate the potential for using digital trace data-in this case, Internet-based information from Google search trends-for estimating disease activity in emerging outbreaks in the absence of accurate real-time healthcare-based data sources. We evaluate how data-driven methods leveraging search trend data would have performed in real-time in five recent outbreaks (yellow fever in Angola, Zika in Colombia, Ebola in the DRC, plague in Madagascar, and cholera in Yemen), and find that the methods frequently provide useful signals of disease activity ahead of standard healthcare-based surveillance methods.",FLU,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP 1195154]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health [R01GM130668],Real-time estimation of disease activity in emerging outbreaks using internet search information,YES

Here, the case study was addressed to Malaria, Leishmaniasis and respiratory diseases in Brazil. Instead of losing a lot of time verifying the consistency of the database, the proposed method uses Decision Tree, a machine learning-based supervised classification, to perform a fast management and extract only relevant and strategic information, with the knowledge of how reliable the database is. Namely, States, Biomes and period of the year (months) with the highest rate of fires could be identified with great success rates and in few seconds. Then, the K-means, an unsupervised learning algorithms that solves the well-known clustering problem, is employed to identify the groups of cities where the fire occurrences is more expressive. Finally, the steps associated with KDD is perfomed to extract useful information from mined data. In that case, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, a nonparametric measure of rank correlation, is computed to infer the statistical dependence between fire occurrences and those diseases.

Nowadays, there is a lack of specific automated systems able to differentiate malaria with respect to other red blood cell inclusions. This study aims to develop a machine learning approach able to discriminate parasitised erythrocytes not only from normal, but also from other erythrocyte inclusions, such as Howell-Jolly and Pappenheimer bodies, basophilic stippling as well as platelets overlying red blood cells. Methods A total of 15 660 erythrocyte images from 87 smears were segmented using histogram thresholding and watershed techniques, which allowed the extraction of 2852 colour and texture features. Dataset was split into a training and assessment sets. Training set was used to develop the whole system, in which several classification approaches were compared with obtain the most accurate recognition. Afterwards, the recognition system was evaluated with the assessment set, performing two steps: (1) classifying each individual cell image to assess the system's recognition ability and (2) analysing whole smears to obtain a malaria infection diagnosis. Results The selection of the best classification approach resulted in a final sequential system with an accuracy of 97.7% for the six groups of red blood cell inclusions. The ability of the system to detect patients infected with malaria showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 90%, respectively. Conclusions The proposed method achieves a high diagnostic performance in the recognition of red blood cell infected with malaria, along with other frequent erythrocyte inclusions.",DIAGNOSIS; PARASITES; MORPHOLOGY,,Sequential classification system for recognition of malaria infection using peripheral blood cell images,YES

Patients with suspected arbovirus infection are difficult to diagnose as symptoms can be vague and molecular testing can be expensive or unavailable. Determining whether these patients should be hospitalized or not can be challenging, especially in resource-limited settings. Our study included data from 543 subjects with a diagnosis of suspected dengue, chikungunya, or Zika infection. Using a machine learning approach, we tested the ability of seven algorithms to predict hospitalization status based on the signs, symptoms, and laboratory data that would be available to a clinician at patient intake. Using only signs and symptoms, we were able to predict hospitalization with high accuracy (94%). Including laboratory data also resulted in highly accurate prediction of hospitalization (92%). This tool should be tested in future studies with new subject data. Upon further development, we envision a simple mobile application to aid in the decision-making process for clinicians in areas with limited resources. Background Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are arboviruses of major global health concern. Decisions regarding the clinical management of suspected arboviral infection are challenging in resource-limited settings, particularly when deciding on patient hospitalization. The objective of this study was to determine if hospitalization of individuals with suspected arboviral infections could be predicted using subject intake data. Methodology/Principal findings Two prediction models were developed using data from a surveillance study in Machala, a city in southern coastal Ecuador with a high burden of arboviral infections. Data were obtained from subjects who presented at sentinel medical centers with suspected arboviral infection (November 2013 to September 2017). The first prediction model-called the Severity Index for Suspected Arbovirus (SISA)-used only demographic and symptom data. The second prediction model-called the Severity Index for Suspected Arbovirus with Laboratory (SISAL)-incorporated laboratory data. These models were selected by comparing the prediction ability of seven machine learning algorithms; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from the prediction of a test dataset was used to select the final algorithm for each model. After eliminating those with missing data, the SISA dataset had 534 subjects, and the SISAL dataset had 98 subjects. For SISA, the best prediction algorithm was the generalized boosting model, with an AUC of 0.91. For SISAL, the best prediction algorithm was the elastic net with an AUC of 0.94.

Malaria disease detection in early stage requires an accurate and precise diagnosis in order to achieve successful patient remission. This paper proposes a comprehensive computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme for identifying the presence of malaria parasites in thick blood smear images. The parameters of the scheme are pre-trained by functional link artificial neural network followed by sparse stacked autoencoder. The optimum size of the CAD scheme used in this research is 12500-2500-100-50-2, where the input layer has 12500 nodes and Softmax classifier output layer has 2 nodes. Moreover, the 10- fold cross validation reflects that the classification is reliable and is applicable to new patient blood smear images. The proposed CAD scheme has been evaluated using malaria blood smear image data set, achieving a detection accuracy of 89.10 & x0025;, a sensitivity of 93.90 & x0025; and specificity of 83.10 & x0025;. The extensive comparative experiment suggests that the proposed CAD scheme provides richer effectiveness and efficiency for malaria data set compared to other deep learning techniques for better diagnosis decision and management.

2020.0,disease surveillance,Universidade do Porto; INESC TEC,"Background As of today, cancer is still one of the most prevalent and high-mortality diseases, summing more than 9 million deaths in 2018. This has motivated researchers to study the application of machine learning-based solutions for cancer detection to accelerate its diagnosis and help its prevention. Among several approaches, one is to automatically classify tumor samples through their gene expression analysis. Methods In this work, we aim to distinguish five different types of cancer through RNA-Seq datasets: thyroid, skin, stomach, breast, and lung. To do so, we have adopted a previously described methodology, with which we compare the performance of 3 different autoencoders (AEs) used as a deep neural network weight initialization technique. Our experiments consist in assessing two different approaches when training the classification model - fixing the weights after pre-training the AEs, or allowing fine-tuning of the entire network - and two different strategies for embedding the AEs into the classification network, namely by only importing the encoding layers, or by inserting the complete AE. We then study how varying the number of layers in the first strategy, the AEs latent vector dimension, and the imputation technique in the data preprocessing step impacts the network's overall classification performance. Finally, with the goal of assessing how well does this pipeline generalize, we apply the same methodology to two additional datasets that include features extracted from images of malaria thin blood smears, and breast masses cell nuclei. We also discard the possibility of overfitting by using held-out test sets in the images datasets. Results The methodology attained good overall results for both RNA-Seq and image extracted data. We outperformed the established baseline for all the considered datasets, achieving an average F(1)score of 99.03, 89.95, and 98.84 and an MCC of 0.99, 0.84, and 0.98, for the RNA-Seq (when detecting thyroid cancer), the Malaria, and the Wisconsin Breast Cancer data, respectively.

Clinical diagnosis is essential, but some of the presented symptoms may go unnoticed, even by specialists. In areas of greater endemicity, serological and molecular tests have been performed and analyzed separately for the follow-up of household contacts, who are at high risk of developing the disease. The accuracy of these tests is still debated, and it is necessary to make them more reliable, especially for the identification of cases of leprosy between contacts. We proposed an integrated analysis of molecular and serological methods using artificial intelligence by the random forest (RF) algorithm to better diagnose and predict new cases of leprosy. Methods The study was developed in Governador Valadares, Brazil, a hyperendemic region for leprosy. A longitudinal study was performed, including new cases diagnosed in 2011 and their respective household contacts, who were followed in 2011, 2012, and 2016. All contacts were diligently evaluated by clinicians from Reference Center for Endemic Diseases (CREDEN-PES) before being classified as asymptomatic. Samples of slit skin smears (SSS) from the earlobe of the patients and household contacts were collected for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of 16S rRNA, and peripheral blood samples were collected for ELISA assays to detect LID-1 and ND-O-LID. Results The statistical analysis of the tests revealed sensitivity for anti-LID-1 (63.2%), anti-ND-O-LID (57.9%), qPCR SSS (36.8%), and smear microscopy (30.2%). However, the use of RF allowed for an expressive increase in sensitivity in the diagnosis of multibacillary leprosy (90.5%) and especially paucibacillary leprosy (70.6%). It is important to report that the specificity was 92.5%. Conclusion The proposed model using RF allows for the diagnosis of leprosy with high sensitivity and specificity and the early identification of new cases among household contacts. Author summary Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) that can infect cells in the skin and nerves. Despite efforts to eliminate leprosy, the number of M. leprae infected individuals who develop leprosy is still substantial in the world. The diagnosis relies mainly on clinical parameters. Histopathological and bacteriological analysis help to classify clinical forms of patients. Serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are claimed by health professionals as auxiliary tools, but until now these tests have been used almost exclusively in research, with minor use in leprosy reference centers throughout Brazil. Here, we tested quantitative PCR (qPCR) designed to amplify specific M. leprae targets and ELISA assays to detect antibody response to recombinant antigens (LID-1, ND-O-LID). All results were analyzed by multivariate analysis based in artificial intelligence. We chose random forest as a classification algorithm to aid in the diagnosis and the monitoring of contacts.

This study investigated whether mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy coupled with supervised machine learning could constitute an alternative method for rapid malaria screening, directly from dried human blood spots. Methods Filter papers containing dried blood spots (DBS) were obtained from a cross-sectional malaria survey in 12 wards in southeastern Tanzania in 2018/19. The DBS were scanned using attenuated total reflection-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectrometer to obtain high-resolution MIR spectra in the range 4000 cm(-1) to 500 cm(-1). The spectra were cleaned to compensate for atmospheric water vapour and CO2 interference bands and used to train different classification algorithms to distinguish between malaria-positive and malaria-negative DBS papers based on PCR test results as reference. The analysis considered 296 individuals, including 123 PCR-confirmed malaria positives and 173 negatives. Model training was done using 80% of the dataset, after which the best-fitting model was optimized by bootstrapping of 80/20 train/test-stratified splits. The trained models were evaluated by predicting Plasmodium falciparum positivity in the 20% validation set of DBS. Results Logistic regression was the best-performing model. Considering PCR as reference, the models attained overall accuracies of 92% for predicting P. falciparum infections (specificity = 91.7%; sensitivity = 92.8%) and 85% for predicting mixed infections of P. falciparum and Plasmodium ovale (specificity = 85%, sensitivity = 85%) in the field-collected specimen. Conclusion These results demonstrate that mid-infrared spectroscopy coupled with supervised machine learning (MIR-ML) could be used to screen for malaria parasites in human DBS. The approach could have potential for rapid and high-throughput screening of Plasmodium in both non-clinical settings (e.g., field surveys) and clinical settings (diagnosis to aid case management). However, before the approach can be used, we need additional field validation in other study sites with different parasite populations, and in-depth evaluation of the biological basis of the MIR signals.

2019.0,disease surveillance,Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata,"Dengue case management is an alarmingly important global health issue. The effective allocation of resources is often difficult due to external and internal factors imposing nonlinear fluctuations in the prevalence of dengue fever. We aimed to construct an early-warning system that could accurately forecast subsequent dengue cases in three dengue endemic regions, namely San Juan, Iquitos, and the Philippines. The problem is solely regarded as a time series forecasting problem ignoring the known epidemiology of dengue fever as well as the other meteorological variables. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is a popular classical time series model for linear data structures whereas with the advent of neural networks, nonlinear structures in the data set can be handled. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid model combining ARIMA and neural network autoregressive (NNAR) model to capture both linearity and nonlinearity in the data sets. The ARIMA model filters out linear tendencies in the data and passes on the residual values to the NNAR model. The proposed hybrid approach is applied to three dengue time-series data sets and is found to give better forecasting accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art. The results of this study indicate that dengue cases can be accurately forecasted over a sufficient time period using the proposed hybrid methodology. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, understanding the characteristics of negative sentiment could help inform federal disease control agencies' efforts to disseminate relevant information to the public about Zika-related issues. Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze the public sentiment concerning Zika using posts on Twitter and determine the qualitative characteristics of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments expressed. Methods: Machine learning techniques and algorithms were used to analyze the sentiment of tweets concerning Zika. A supervised machine learning classifier was built to classify tweets into 3 sentiment categories: positive, neutral, and negative. Tweets in each category were then examined using a topic-modeling approach to determine the main topics for each category, with focus on the negative category. Results: A total of 5303 tweets were manually annotated and used to train multiple classifiers. These performed moderately well (F1 score=0.48-0.68) with text-based feature extraction. All 48,734 tweets were then categorized into the sentiment categories. Overall, 10 topics for each sentiment category were identified using topic modeling, with a focus on the negative sentiment category. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates how sentiment expressed within discussions of epidemics on Twitter can be discovered. This allows public health officials to understand public sentiment regarding an epidemic and enables them to address specific elements of negative sentiment in real time. Our negative sentiment classifier was able to identify tweets concerning Zika with 3 broad themes: neural defects,Zika abnormalities, and reports and findings.

Objective: Using Twitter posts regarding the 2015-16 Zika virus outbreak, we sought to identify and describe considerations and self-disclosures of a specific behavior change relevant to the spread of disease-travel cancellation. If this type of behavior is identifiable in Twitter, this approach may provide an additional source of data for disease modeling. Methods: We combined keyword filtering and machine learning classification to identify first-person reactions to Zika in 29,386 English-language tweets in the context of travel, including considerations and reports of travel cancellation. We further explored demographic, network, and linguistic characteristics of users who change their behavior compared with control groups. Results: We found differences in the demographics, social networks, and linguistic patterns of 1567 individuals identified as changing or considering changing travel behavior in response to Zika as compared with a control sample of Twitter users. We found significant differences between geographic areas in the United States, significantly more discussion by women than men, and some evidence of differences in levels of exposure to Zika-related information.

Sample spectra from 318 patients were used for building calibration models (112 positive and 110 negative samples according to PCR testing) and independent validation testing (39 positive and 57 negatives samples by PCR). Results The machine learning classification (support vector machines; SVM) performed with 92% sensitivity (3 false negatives) and 97% specificity (2 false positives). The Area Under the Receiver Operation Curve (AUROC) for the SVM classification was 0.98. These results may be better than as stated as one of the spectroscopy false positives was infected by a Plasmodium species other than Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax, not detected by the PCR primers employed. Conclusions In conclusion, it was demonstrated that ATR-FTIR spectroscopy could be used as an efficient and reliable malaria diagnostic tool and has the potential to be developed for use at point of care under tropical field conditions with spectra able to be analysed via a Cloud-based system, and the diagnostic results returned to the user's mobile telephone or computer. The combination of accessibility to mass screening, high sensitivity and selectivity, low logistics requirements and portability, makes this new approach a potentially outstanding tool in the context of malaria elimination programmes.

Originating from Asia, this invasive species is rapidly expanding into North American temperate areas and urbanized places causing major concerns for public health. Previous analyses show that warm temperatures and high humidity during the mosquito season are ideal conditions for A. albopictus development, while its distribution is correlated with population density. To better understand A. albopictus expansion into urban places it is important to consider the role of both environmental and neighborhood factors. The present study aims to assess the relative importance of both environmental variables and neighborhood factors in the prediction of A. albopictus' presence in Southeast Pennsylvania using MaxEnt (version 3.4.1) machine-learning algorithm. Three models are developed that include: (1) exclusively environmental variables, (2) exclusively neighborhood factors, and (3) a combination of environmental variables and neighborhood factors. Outcomes from the three models are compared in terms of variable importance, accuracy, and the spatial distribution of predicted A. albopictus'presence. All three models predicted the presence of A. albopictus in urban centers, however, each to a different spatial extent. The combined model resulted in the highest accuracy (74.7%) compared to the model with only environmental variables (73.5%) and to the model with only neighborhood factors (72.1%) separately. Although the combined model does not essentially increase the accuracy in the prediction, the spatial patterns of mosquito distribution are different when compared to environmental or neighborhood factors alone. Environmental variables help to explain conditions associated with mosquitoes in suburban/rural areas, while neighborhood factors summarize the local conditions that can also impact mosquito habitats in predominantly urban places. Overall, the present study shows that MaxEnt is suitable for integrating neighborhood factors associated with mosquito presence that can complement and improve species distribution modeling.",SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; AEGYPTI; MOSQUITO; CLIMATE; DENGUE; URBAN; PRECIPITATION; DIFFERENCE; ECOLOGY; AREA,"Office of the Vice President for Research Administration at Temple University under the Targeted Funding Program; Colleges of Liberal Arts, Public Health and Science and Technology at Temple University under the Targeted Funding Program",Integrating environmental and neighborhood factors in MaxEnt modeling to predict species distributions: A case study of Aedes albopictus in southeastern Pennsylvania,YES

2019.0,diagnosis,National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Library of Medicine (NLM),"Background. Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by Plasmodium parasites that infect the red blood cells (RBCs). Manual identification and counting of parasitized cells in microscopic thick/thin-film blood examination remains the common, but burdensome method for disease diagnosis. Its diagnostic accuracy is adversely impacted by inter/intra-observer variability, particularly in large-scale screening under resource-constrained settings. Introduction. State-of-the-art computer-aided diagnostic tools based on data-driven deep learning algorithms like convolutional neural network (CNN) has become the architecture of choice for image recognition tasks. However, CNNs suffer from high variance and may overfit due to their sensitivity to training data fluctuations. Objective. The primary aim of this study is to reduce model variance, improve robustness and generalization through constructing model ensembles toward detecting parasitized cells in thin-blood smear images. Methods. We evaluate the performance of custom and pretrained CNNs and construct an optimal model ensemble toward the challenge of classifying parasitized and normal cells in thin-blood smear images. Cross-validation studies are performed at the patient level to ensure preventing data leakage into the validation and reduce generalization errors. The models are evaluated in terms of the following performance metrics: (a) Accuracy; (b) Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC); (c) Mean squared error (MSE); (d) Precision; (e) F-score; and (f) Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Results. It is observed that the ensemble model constructed with VGG-19 and SqueezeNet outperformed the state-of-the-art in several performance metrics toward classifying the parasitized and uninfected cells to aid in improved disease screening. Conclusions. Ensemble learning reduces the model variance by optimally combining the predictions of multiple models and decreases the sensitivity to the specifics of training data and selection of training algorithms. The performance of the model ensemble simulates real-world conditions with reduced variance, overfitting and leads to improved generalization.",CLASSIFICATION,"Intramural Research Program of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), National Institutes of Health (NIH); Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications (LHNCBC); National Library of Medicine [ZIALM010006, ZIALM010004] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",Performance evaluation of deep neural ensembles toward malaria parasite detection in thin-blood smear images,YES

This approach, none-theless, demands a considerable amount of time and resources such as kits and reagents that, in endemic areas, may result in a substantial financial burden over affected individuals and health services veering away from RT-PCR analysis.

To determine the association of schistosomiasis and arsenicosis with bladder pathologies, 122 individuals from Eggua in southwest Nigeria were recruited for this study. Methods: Prevalence of schistosomiasis was determined by urine microscopy and PCR. Total urinary arsenic concentration and arsenic Levels in three different water sources in the community were assessed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Bladder pathologies were investigated by ultrasonography. The data collected were evaluated with chi-square (chi(2)) and ANOVA tests to examine the relationships among demographic factors, infection, bladder pathologies and urinary arsenic concentrations. Results: The prevalence and mean intensity of schistosomiasis were 21.3% and 20.7 eggs/10 mL urine, respectively. Arsenic concentration in two of the water sources, River Yewa (0.46 mg/L) and borehole (0.52 mg/L), were above the WHO standard (0.01 mg/L); and the mean concentration in urine samples, 1.17 mg/L, was also above the WHO standard (0.2 mg/L). There was no evidence of an association between bladder pathology and arsenicosis, or between schistosomiasis associated-bladder pathology and arsenicosis (p=0.66).

2018.0,drug discovery,Universidade da Coruna; University of Basque Country; Basque Foundation for Science,"The spatial distribution of genes in chromosomes seems not to be random. For instance, only 10% of genes are transcribed from bidirectional promoters in humans, and many more are organized into larger clusters. This raises intriguing questions previously asked by different authors. We would like to add a few more questions in this context, related to gene orientation inversions. Does gene orientation (inversion) follow a random pattern? Is it relevant to biological activity somehow? We define a new kind of network coined as the gene orientation inversion network (GOIN). GOIN's complex network encodes short- and long-range patterns of inversion of the orientation of pairs of gene in the chromosome. We selected Plasmodium falciparum as a case of study due to the high relevance of this parasite to public health (causal agent of malaria). We constructed here for the first time all of the GOINs for the genome of this parasite. These networks have an average of 383 nodes (genes in one chromosome) and 1314 links (pairs of gene with inverse orientation). We calculated node centralities and other parameters of these networks. These numerical parameters were used to study different properties of gene inversion patterns, for example, distribution, local communities, similarity to Erdos-Renyi random networks, randomness, and so on. We find clues that seem to indicate that gene orientation inversion does not follow a random pattern. We noted that some gene communities in the GOINs tend to group genes encoding for RIFIN-related proteins in the proteome of the parasite. RIFIN-like proteins are a second family of clonally variant proteins expressed on the surface of red cells infected with Plasmodium falciparum. Consequently, we used these centralities as input of machine learning (ML) models to predict the RIFIN-like activity of 5365 proteins in the proteome of Plasmodium sp. The best linear ML model found discriminates RIFIN-like from other proteins with sensitivity and specificity 70-80% in training and external validation series. All of these results may point to a possible biological relevance of gene orientation inversion not directly dependent on genetic sequence information. This work opens the gate to the use of GOINs as a tool for the study of the structure of chromosomes and the study of protein function in proteome research.",COMPLEX NETWORKS; FALCIPARUM PROTEOME; SOCIAL NETWORKS; SUPREME-COURT; MIANN MODELS; INDEXES; US; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PARASITOLOGY; INFORMATION,MINECO [CTQ2013-41229-P]; MINECO of Spain government [CTQ2016-74881-P]; Basque Government [IT1045-16]; Universidad Estatal AmazOnica (UEA) scholarship,Chromosome Gene Orientation Inversion Networks (GOINs) of Plasmodium Proteome,YES

Pathogen are all infectious agents such as a virus, bacterium, protozoa, prion etc. However, there is often a lack of specialists in the handling of microscopes, hence allowing the need to make the microscopic analysis abroad. This results in a considerable loss of time and in the meantime, the epidemic continues to spread. To save time in the analysis of samples, we propose to make the future microscopes more intelligent so that they will be able to indicate by themselves the existence or not of the pathogen of an epidemic in a sample. To have a smart microscope, we propose a methodology based on efficient Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architecture in order to classify epidemic pathogen with five deep learning phases: (1) Training dataset of provided images (2) CNN Training (3) Testing data preparation (4) CNN generated model on testing data and finally (5) Evaluation of images classified. The resulted classification process can be integrated in a mobile computing solution on future microscopes. CNN can improve the accuracy in pathogens diagnosis that are focused on hand-tuned feature extraction implying some human mistakes. For our study, we consider cholera and malaria epidemics for microscopic images classification with a relevant CNN, respectively Vibrio cholerae images and Plasmodium falciparum images. Image classification is the task of taking an input image and outputting a class or a probability of classes that best describes the image. Interesting results have been obtained from the CNN model generated achieving the classification accuracy of 94%, with 200 Vibrio cholera images and 200 Plasmodium falciparum images for training dataset and 80 images for testing data.

Among the 13 descriptors, 10 features were highly statistically different between healthy RBCs (hRBCs) and iRBCs. Six machine learning algorithms were applied to effectively combine the dominant features and to greatly improve the diagnostic capacity of the present method.

During the fine-tuning process based on training datasets of A. aegypti and A. albopictus, RF models achieved the highest performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.973 and 0.974, respectively, followed by GBM (AUC of 0.971 and 0.972, respectively) and SVM (AUC of 0.963 and 0.964, respectively) models. The simulation difference between RF and GBM models was not statistically significant (p > 0.05) based on the validation datasets, whereas statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed for RF and GBM simulations compared with SVM simulations. From the simulated maps derived from RF models, we observed that the distribution of A. albopictus was wider than that of A. aegypti along a latitudinal gradient. The discriminatory power of each factor in simulating the global distribution of the two species was also analyzed. Our results provided fundamental information for further study on disease transmission simulation and risk assessment.",ZIKA VIRUS; CHIKUNGUNYA VIRUS; DIPTERA; CULICIDAE; SPREAD; MOSQUITO; CLIMATE; COMPETENCE; ISOLATIONS; PATTERNS,Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2016YFC1201300],Mapping the spatial distribution of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus,YES

Suitability mapping of the transmission risk of Zika virus is essential for drafting public health plans and disease control strategies, which are especially important in areas where medical resources are relatively scarce. Predicting the risk of Zika virus outbreak has been studied in recent years, but the published literature rarely includes multiple model comparisons or predictive uncertainty analysis. Here, three relatively popular machine learning models including backward propagation neural network (BPNN), gradient boosting machine (GBM) and random forest (RF) were adopted to map the probability of Zika epidemic outbreak at the global level, pairing high-dimensional multidisciplinary covariate layers with comprehensive location data on recorded Zika virus infection in humans. The results show that the predicted high-risk areas for Zika transmission are concentrated in four regions: Southeastern North America, Eastern South America, Central Africa and Eastern Asia. To evaluate the performance of machine learning models, the 50 modeling processes were conducted based on a training dataset. The BPNN model obtained the highest predictive accuracy with a 10-fold cross-validation area under the curve (AUC) of 0.966 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.965-0.967], followed by the GBM model (10-fold cross-validation AUC = 0.964[0.963-0.965]) and the RF model (10-fold cross-validation AUC = 0.963[0.962-0.964]). Based on training samples, compared with the BPNN-based model, we find that significant differences (p = 0.0258* and p = 0.0001***, respectively) are observed for prediction accuracies achieved by the GBM and RF models. Importantly, the prediction uncertainty introduced by the selection of absence data was quantified and could provide more accurate fundamental and scientific information for further study on disease transmission prediction and risk assessment.",AEDES-AEGYPTI DIPTERA; VECTOR-BORNE DISEASE; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; OUTBREAK; HISTORY; ISOLATIONS; ALBOPICTUS; CULICIDAE; INFECTION; EPIDEMIC,Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2016YFC1201300],Mapping the transmission risk of Zika virus using machine learning models,YES

In particular, Aedes cegypti (Linnaeus) is the main vector for Chikungunya, Dengue, and Zika viruses in Latin America and it represents a global threat. Public health policies that aim at combating this vector require dependable and timely information, which is usually expensive to obtain with field campaigns. For this reason, several efforts have been done to use remote sensing due to its reduced cost. The present work includes the temporal modeling of the oviposition activity (measured weekly on 50 ovitraps in a north Argentinean city) of Aedes cegypti (Linnaeus), based on time series of data extracted from operational earth observation satellite images. We use are NDVI, NDWI, LST night, LST day and TRMM-GPM rain from 2012 to 2016 as predictive variables. In contrast to previous works which use linear models, we employ Machine Learning techniques using completely accessible open source toolkits. These models have the advantages of being non-parametric and capable of describing nonlinear relationships between variables. Specifically, in addition to two linear approaches, we assess a support vector machine, an artificial neural networks, a K-nearest neighbors and a decision tree regressor. Considerations are made on parameter tuning and the validation and training approach. The results are compared to linear models used in previous works with similar data sets for generating temporal predictive models. These new tools perform better than linear approaches, in particular nearest neighbor regression (KNNR) performs the best.

Existing screening methods that are based on manual microscopic examination often struggle to provide sufficient volumetric throughput and sensitivity to facilitate early diagnosis. Here, we demonstrate a motility-based label-free computational imaging platform to rapidly detect motile parasites in optically dense bodily fluids by utilizing the locomotion of the parasites as a specific biomarker and endogenous contrast mechanism. Based on this principle, a cost-effective and mobile instrument, which rapidly screens similar to 3.2 mL of fluid sample in three dimensions, was built to automatically detect and count motile microorganisms using their holographic time-lapse speckle patterns. We demonstrate the capabilities of our platform by detecting trypanosomes, which are motile protozoan parasites, with various species that cause deadly diseases affecting millions of people worldwide. Using a holographic speckle analysis algorithm combined with deep learningbased classification, we demonstrate sensitive and label-free detection of trypanosomes within spiked whole blood and artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, achieving a limit of detection of ten trypanosomes per mL of whole blood (similar to five-fold better than the current state-of-the-art parasitological method) and three trypanosomes per mL of CSF. We further demonstrate that this platform can be applied to detect other motile parasites by imaging Trichomonas vaginalis, the causative agent of trichomoniasis, which affects 275 million people worldwide. With its costeffective, portable design and rapid screening time, this unique platform has the potential to be applied for sensitive and timely diagnosis of neglected tropical diseases caused by motile parasites and other parasitic infections in resource-limited regions.",TRYPANOSOMA-CRUZI; TRICHOMONAS-VAGINALIS; CHAGAS-DISEASE; DIAGNOSIS; SENSITIVITY; INFECTIONS; VIRULENCE; BLOOD,"NSF Engineering Research Center (ERC, PATHS-UP); ARO Life Sciences Division; Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI); US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [AI052348]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [R01AI052348] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",Motility-based label-free detection of parasites in bodily fluids using holographic speckle analysis and deep learning,YES

In Brazil, the first reported case of ZIKV infection was in May 2015. Additionally, dengue (DENV) is endemic and there has been a recent outbreak of chikungunya (CHIKV). Since the clinical manifestations of different arboviral infections (AI) can be similar, definitive diagnosis requires laboratory testing. Objectives To determine the prevalence of ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV infections in a Brazilian cohort of HIV-infected pregnant women, to assess clinical/immunological characteristics and pregnancy outcomes of women with evidence of recent AI. Study design Laboratory diagnosis of ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV infections utilized serological assays, RT-PCR and PRNT. The tests were performed at the first visit, 34-36 weeks of gestation and at any time if a woman had symptoms suggestive of AI. Mann-Whitney tests were used for comparison of medians, Chi-square or Fisher's to compare proportions; p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Poisson regression was used to analyze risk factors for central nervous system (CNS) malformations in the infant according to maternal symptomatology. Results Of 219 HIV-infected pregnant women enrolled, 92% were DENV IgG+; 47(22%) had laboratory evidence of recent AI. Of these, 34 (72%) were ZIKV+, nine (19%) CHIKV+, and two (4%) DENV+. Symptoms consistent with AI were observed in 23 (10%) women, of whom 10 (43%) were ZIKV+, eight (35%) CHIKV+. No CNS abnormalities were observed among infants of DENV+ or CHIKV+ women; four infants with CNS abnormalities were born to ZIKV+ women (three symptomatic). Infants born to ZIKV+ women had a higher risk of CNS malformations if the mother was symptomatic (RR = 7.20), albeit not statistically significant (p = 0.066).

Microscopists commonly examine thick and thin blood smears to diagnose disease and compute parasitemia. However, their accuracy depends on smear quality and expertise in classifying and counting parasitized and uninfected cells. Such an examination could be arduous for large-scale diagnoses resulting in poor quality. State-of-the-art image-analysis based computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) methods using machine learning (ML) techniques, applied to microscopic images of the smears using hand-engineered features demand expertise in analyzing morphological, textural, and positional variations of the region of interest (ROI). In contrast, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a class of deep learning (DL) models promise highly scalable and superior results with end-to-end feature extraction and classification. Automated malaria screening using DL techniques could, therefore, serve as an effective diagnostic aid. In this study, we evaluate the performance of pre-trained CNN based DL models as feature extractors toward classifying parasitized and uninfected cells to aid in improved disease screening.

This paper presents baseline data that were collected in ten districts of Cabo Delgado province, northern Mozambique, before treatment. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 19,039 individuals was sampled from 144 villages from May to September 2011. In each village prevalence and intensity of S. haematobium were investigated in 100 children first-year students (aged 5-8 years), 100 school children aged 9-12 years (from classes 2 to 7) and 50 adults (20-55 years). Prevalence and intensity of S. haematobium infection were evaluated microscopically by two filtrations, each of 10 ml, from a single urine specimen. Given that individual and community perceptions of schistosomiasis influence control efforts, community knowledge and environmental risk factors were collected using a face-to-face interview. Data were entered onto mobile phones using EpiCollect. Data summary was made using descriptive statistics. Chi-square and logistic regression were used to determine the association between dependent and independent variables. Results: The overall prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis was 60.4% with an arithmetic mean intensity of infection of 55.8 eggs/10 ml of urine. Heavy infections were detected in 17.7%, of which 235 individuals (6.97%) had an egg count of 1000 eggs/10 ml or more. There was a significantly higher likelihood of males being infected than females across all ages (62% vs 58%; P < 0.0005). Adolescents aged 9-12 years had a higher prevalence (66.6%) and mean infection intensity (71.9 eggs/10 ml) than first-year students (63.1%; 58.2 eggs/10 ml). This is the first study in Mozambique looking at infection rates among adults. Although children had higher levels of infection, it was found here that adults had a high average prevalence and intensity of infection (44.5%; 23.9 eggs/10 ml). Awareness of schistosomiasis was relatively high (68.6%); however, correct knowledge of how schistosomiasis is acquired was low (23.2%) among those who had heard of the disease. Schistosomiasis risk behaviour such as washing (91.3%) and bathing (86.7%) in open water sources likely to be infested with host snails was high. Conclusions: Urogenital schistosomiasis is widespread in Cabo Delgado. In addition, poor community knowledge about the causes of schistosomiasis and how to prevent it increases the significant public health challenge for the national control program. This was the first study in Mozambique that examined infection levels among adults, where results showed that S. haematobium infection was also extremely high. Given that this controlled trial aims to understand the impact of different combinations of schistosomiasis control through treatment of communities, schools, and treatment holidays over a five-year period, these findings highlight the importance of examining the impact of different treatment approaches also in adults.",HAEMATOBIUM INFECTION; URINARY SCHISTOSOMIASIS; RISK-FACTORS; SCHOOLCHILDREN; AGE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; PREVALENCE; PATTERNS; DISEASES,"Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation through the Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE) based at the University of Georgia in Athens, United States of America [RR3/4-053/4893196]","Urogenital schistosomiasis in Cabo Delgado, northern Mozambique: baseline findings from the SCORE study",NO

Research on humans and in animal models has shown that infection by malaria parasites elicits changes in host odors that influence vector attraction, suggesting that such changes might yield robust biomarkers of infection status. Here we present findings based on extensive collections of skin volatiles from human populations with high rates of malaria infection in Kenya. We report broad and consistent effects of malaria infection on human volatile profiles, as well as significant divergence in the effects of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. Furthermore, predictive models based on machine learning algorithms reliably determined infection status based on volatile biomarkers. Critically, our models identified asymptomatic infections with 100% sensitivity, even in the case of low-level infections not detectable by microscopy, far exceeding the performance of currently available rapid diagnostic tests in this regard. We also identified a set of individual compounds that emerged as consistently important predictors of infection status.

Deep learning is based on an artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers and has found considerable traction for many artificial intelligence applications. We have previously suggested the need for a comparison of different machine learning methods with deep learning across an array of varying data sets that is applicable to pharmaceutical research. End points relevant to pharmaceutical research include absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/Tox) properties, as well as activity against pathogens and drug discovery data sets.

Objective: Evaluation of the imaging performance of a miniature digital microscopy scanner for the diagnosis of soil-transmitted helminths and Schistosoma haematobium, and training of a deep learning-based image analysis algorithm for automated detection of soil-transmitted helminths in the captured images. Methods: A total of 13 iodine-stained stool samples containing Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworm eggs and 4 urine samples containing Schistosoma haematobium were digitized using a reference whole slide-scanner and the mobile microscopy scanner. Parasites in the images were identified by visual examination and by analysis with a deep learning-based image analysis algorithm in the stool samples. Results were compared between the digital and visual analysis of the images showing helminth eggs. Results: Parasite identification by visual analysis of digital slides captured with the mobile microscope was feasible for all analyzed parasites. Although the spatial resolution of the reference slide-scanner is higher, the resolution of the mobile microscope is sufficient for reliable identification and classification of all parasites studied.

The time series analysis methodology, particularly ARIMA and SARIMA, has been increasingly applied to the field of epidemiological research for dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and other infectious diseases. The main drawback of these methods is that they do not consider other variables that are associated with the dependent variable. Additionally, new factors correlated to the disease are needed to enhance the prediction accuracy of the model when it is applied to areas of similar climates, where weather factors such as temperature, total rainfall, and humidity are not substantially different. Such drawbacks may consequently lower the predictive power for the outbreak. Results: The predictive power of the forecasting model-assessed by Akaike's information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)-is improved by including the new parameters for dengue outbreak prediction. This study's selected model outperforms all three other competing models with the lowest AIC, the lowest BIC, and a small MAPE value. The exclusive use of climate factors from similar locations decreases a model's prediction power. The multivariate Poisson regression, however, effectively forecasts even when climate variables are slightly different. Female mosquitoes and seasons were strongly correlated with dengue cases. Therefore, the dengue incidence trends provided by this model will assist the optimization of dengue prevention. Conclusions: The present work demonstrates the important roles of female mosquito infection rates from the previous season and climate factors (represented as seasons) in dengue outbreaks. Incorporating these two factors in the model significantly improves the predictive power of dengue hemorrhagic fever forecasting models, as confirmed by AIC, BIC, and MAPE.",ALBOPICTUS DIPTERA-CULICIDAE; AEDES-AEGYPTI; TRANSMISSION; VIRUSES; ASSOCIATION; THAILAND; INDEXES; MODEL; RISK,National Research Council Thailand [Phor Khor/2555-125]; National Science and Technology Development Agency (Thailand),Analysis of significant factors for dengue fever incidence prediction,NO

In drug discovery, researchers use this methodology, looking to find new chemotherapeutic agents for various diseases. The neglected diseases are a group of tropical parasitic diseases that primarily affect poor countries in Africa, Asia, and South America. Current drugs against these diseases cause side effects, are ineffective during the chronic stages of the disease, and are often not available to the needy population, have relative high toxicity, and face developing resistance. Faced with so many problems, new chemotherapeutic agents to treat these infections are much needed.

2015.0,drug discovery,University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"A large quantity of high throughput screening (HTS) data for antimalarial activity has become available in recent years. This includes both phenotypic and target-based activity. Realising the maximum value of these data remains a challenge. In this respect, methods that allow such data to be used for virtual screening maximise efficiency and reduce costs. In this study both in vitro antimalarial activity and inhibitory data for beta-haematin formation, largely obtained from publically available sources, has been used to develop Bayesian models for inhibitors of beta-haematinformation and in vitro antimalarial activity. These models were used to screen two in silico compound libraries. In the first, the 1510 U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved drugs available on PubChem were ranked from highest to lowest Bayesian score based on a training set of beta-haematin inhibiting compounds active against Plasmodium falciparum that did not include any of the clinical antimalarials or close analogues. The six known clinical antimalarials that inhibit beta-haematin formation were ranked in the top 2.1% of compounds. Furthermore, the in vitro antimalarial hit-rate for this prioritised set of compounds was found to be 81% in the case of the subset where activity data are available in PubChem. In the second, a library of about 5000 commercially available compounds (Aldrich(CPR)) was virtually screened for ability to inhibit beta-haematin formation and then for in vitro antimalarial activity. A selection of 34 compounds was purchased and tested, of which 24 were predicted to be beta-haematin inhibitors. The hit rate for inhibition of beta-haematin formation was found to be 25% and a third of these were active against P. falciparum, corresponding to enrichments estimated at about 25-and 140-fold relative to random screening, respectively.

Onset of circulatory collapse can be unpredictable. Biomarkers that can identify individuals at risk of plasma leakage may facilitate better triage and clinical management. Design: Using a nested case-control design, we randomly selected subjects from a prospective cohort study of dengue in Colombia (n = 1582). Using serum collected within 96 hours of fever onset, we tested 19 biomarkers by ELISA in cases (developed dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS); n = 46), and controls (uncomplicated dengue fever (DF); n = 65) and healthy controls (HC); n = 15. Results: Ang-1 levels were lower and angptl3, sKDR, sEng, sICAM-1, CRP, CXCL10/IP-10, IL-18 binding protein, CHI3L1, C5a and Factor D levels were increased in dengue compared to HC. sICAM-1, sEng and CXCL10/IP-10 were further elevated in subjects who subsequently developed DHF/DSS (p = 0.008, p = 0.028 and p = 0.025, respectively). In a logistic regression model, age (odds ratio (OR) (95% CI): 0.95 (0.92-0.98), p = 0.001), hyperesthesia/hyperalgesia (OR; 3.8 (1.4-10.4), p = 0.008) and elevated sICAM-1 (>298ng/mL: OR; 6.3 (1.5-25.7), p = 0.011) at presentation were independently associated with progression to DHF/DSS. Conclusions: These results suggest that inflammation and endothelial activation are important pathways in the pathogenesis of dengue and sICAM-1 levels may identify individuals at risk of plasma leakage.

The current clinical and preclinical pipeline for T. cruzi is extremely sparse and lacks drug target diversity. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study we developed a computational approach that utilized data from several public whole- cell, phenotypic high throughput screens that have been completed for T. cruzi by the Broad Institute, including a single screen of over 300,000 molecules in the search for chemical probes as part of the NIH Molecular Libraries program. We have also compiled and curated relevant biological and chemical compound screening data including (i) compounds and biological activity data from the literature, (ii) high throughput screening datasets, and (iii) predicted metabolites of T. cruzi metabolic pathways. This information was used to help us identify compounds and their potential targets. We have constructed a Pathway Genome Data Base for T. cruzi. In addition, we have developed Bayesian machine learning models that were used to virtually screen libraries of compounds. Ninety-seven compounds were selected for in vitro testing, and 11 of these were found to have EC50 < 10 mu M. We progressed five compounds to an in vivo mouse efficacy model of Chagas disease and validated that the machine learning model could identify in vitro active compounds not in the training set, as well as known positive controls. The antimalarial pyronaridine possessed 85.2% efficacy in the acute Chagas mouse model. We have also proposed potential targets (for future verification) for this compound based on structural similarity to known compounds with targets in T. cruzi.

The survival rate is generally higher when this disease is detected in its early stages. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the development of decision support systems that help physicians diagnose diseases. However, these systems often provide final predictions without clarifying how those decisions are reached, raising concerns about trust and adaptation in life-threatening diseases. To address these issues, this study proposes an explainable case-based reasoning (XCBR) approach that considers both physicians’ tendency to base their decisions on past cases and the case complexity in its predictions and explanations. The proposed XCBR is enhanced with naïve Bayes (NB) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifiers which are processed hierarchically: when the NB deems its predictions to be unlikely, the MLP classifier is employed to verify or update the predictions. This approach incorporates Shapley additive explanations values to elucidate the solutions offered by the MLP. Furthermore, it utilizes the Harris hawks optimization algorithm for feature selection and feature weighting. The proposed XCBR achieved high accuracies of 94.47 % and 100 % on two different datasets, demonstrating its generalization capability. Based on Wilcoxon signed-rank test, its classification accuracy is comparable to that of other state-of-the-art approaches and commonly used classifiers. Moreover, since this approach prioritizes case complexity in its predictions and explanations, it offers better explainability and is particularly suited for serious diseases. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Case complexity; Case-based reasoning; Explainable AI; Feature selection; Lung cancer; Medical expert system,,A novel case-based reasoning system for explainable lung cancer diagnosis,YES

This study’s dataset was obtained from medical records collected from two hospitals in Indonesia from patients with dengue and nondengue diseases. Four feature selection methods including feature importance, recursive feature elimination, correlation matrix and KBest were leveraged to determine significant features. Feature importance employed a tree-based classifier to derive the importance scores of the features. Recursive feature elimination employed a machine learning classifier to choose the most important features from the given dataset. Correlation matrix was employed to select the best features because it has the ability to use the correlation between each feature with the target. Univariate feature selection – Kbest has the ability to choose the best features based on univariate statistical tests. Important features were also gathered from fifteen Indonesian medical doctors to confirm the results. We used six machine learning techniques for dengue prediction.

This research paper establishes a mathematical model to describe the dynamics of secondary immunity in infants against dengue hemorrhagic fever, who acquired primary immunity through maternal antibodies. The effect of passive immunity in the form of dengue immunoglobulin is analyzed for high-risk patients for different scenarios, including standard dengue infections, host with pre-existing immunity, delayed diagnosis or treatment, and end-stage dengue cases. Convergence analysis of the model is performed through disease free and disease endemic equilibrium points in terms of basic reproduction number R0 along with local stability of disease-free equilibrium point. Adams numerical approach is utilized to simulate dengue disease/immunity interactions. A time delay exogenous neural network approach coupled with Levenberg–Marquardt optimization is designed to characterize, model and simulate these curated scenarios. Exhaustive neural network procedures determine the efficacy of the neural network approach by means of mean square error (MSE) loss charts, error correlation graphs, error histogram analysis and time-series prediction charts. The impeccable characterization of the dengue fever scenarios is supported by extremely low MSE results of the order 10−9 to 10−11.

However, the entire strain curve may entail important prognostic information regarding HF risk that might be undiscovered by only focusing on the peak strain value. Objective: The hypothesis of the present study was, that analysis of the entire strain curve using unsupervised machine learning (uML) would reveal novel ventricular deformation patterns capable of predicting incident HF independently of GLS. Methods: Longitudinal strain curves from 3710 subjects from the general population without prevalent HF were analyzed using uML. Results: Mean age was 56 years and 43 % were male. During a median follow-up of 5.3 years, 92 subjects (2.5 %) developed HF. The uML algorithm generated a hierarchical clustering tree (HCT) resulting in 10 different clusters. Generally, the strain curves displayed reduced early diastolic strain to peak-strain ratio with an increasing incidence rate of HF.

2025.0,diagnosis,"Department of Computer Engineering and Applications, GLA university, Mathura, India","Malaria remains an important worldwide challenge, with millions of cases reported annually, especially in resource-constrained regions. Effective treatment and disease management of malaria depend on a prompt and precise diagnosis. In this work, we present a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning method for malaria identification. Our research leverages a comprehensive dataset comprising thousands of blood smear images collected from diverse malaria-endemic regions. We pre-process the images to enhance their quality and ensure consistency across the dataset. We then employ a CNN architecture, trained on this dataset, to automatically learn discriminative features from the blood smear images. The trained CNN model demonstrates remarkable performance in malaria detection, achieving an accuracy of over 95% on a hold-out test set. Moreover, our model exhibits high sensitivity and specificity, which are essential for reducing false positives and false negatives in the diagnosis of malaria.

2025.0,drug discovery,"Department of Biotechnology, Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT), Allahabad, Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, India","The field of drug discovery and development is undergoing a transformative revolution driven by the integration of in silico and bioinformatics approaches. These computational methods are reshaping traditional paradigms by enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and improving the precision and success rate of identifying new therapeutic agents. Traditional drug discovery is a time-consuming and costly process, often taking over a decade and billions of dollars to bring a new drug to market. It involves multiple stages, including target identification, lead discovery, preclinical testing, clinical trials, and regulatory approval. The high attrition rate, particularly in the later stages, underscores the need for more efficient and accurate methods. This is where in silico and bioinformatics approaches come into play, offering a paradigm shift in how drugs are discovered and developed. Virtual screening or molecular docking is a computational technique that predicts the preferred orientation of a drug molecule (ligand) when bound to its target protein. This approach helps identify potential drug candidates by evaluating their binding affinity to the target. Tools like AutoDock, UCSF Chimera, PyRx, and Schrödinger Glide facilitate the rapid screening of large compound libraries, significantly accelerating the initial stages of drug discovery. An example of molecular docking success is the development of protease inhibitors for HIV treatment, such as saquinavir. These inhibitors were designed by docking various compounds to the HIV protease enzyme, leading to effective drugs that inhibit viral replication. ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) properties are crucial for the success of a drug candidate. Computational ADMET prediction tools, such as ADMET Predictor, SwissADME, Protox II, and pkCSM, evaluate these properties early in the development process. By identifying compounds with favourable ADMET profiles, researchers can focus on candidates with a higher likelihood of clinical success. For instance, ADMET predictions have played a key role in the development of drugs like rivaroxaban, an anticoagulant used to prevent blood clots, by ensuring favourable pharmacokinetic properties and minimizing adverse effects. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations go a step further by studying the physical movements of atoms and molecules over time. MD simulations provide detailed insights into the stability and behaviour of drug-target interactions, allowing researchers to understand the dynamic nature of these complexes and refine drug designs accordingly. For instance, MD simulations have been pivotal in developing drugs targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in cancer therapy, such as gefitinib, used to treat non-small cell lung cancer. On the other hand, QSAR models establish a correlation between the chemical structure of compounds and their biological activity using statistical and machine learning techniques. These models predict the efficacy and toxicity of new compounds, enabling the selection of promising candidates early in the development process. For example, QSAR models have been used in designing novel antimalarial drugs by predicting the activity of new compounds against Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for malaria. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are revolutionizing bioinformatics by enabling the analysis of large and complex datasets. ML algorithms can predict drug-target interactions, optimize lead compounds, and model biological processes. For example, AI-driven platforms like DeepChem use neural networks to predict the activity and toxicity of compounds, significantly enhancing the efficiency of drug discovery. AI has been utilized in developing drugs like baricitinib, initially identified using machine learning models for repurposing in treating rheumatoid arthritis and later found effective against COVID-19. © 2025 Anjana Pandey, Rakesh Kumar, and Ashutosh Pandey.

A publicly available Vietnamese dataset of 2301 Vietnamese children aged 5 to 15 years who developed dengue shock syndrome (DSS) between 2001 and 2009 was used to build a DSS predictive model using machine learning algorithms. Missing values of clinical and laboratory variables were imputed using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) technique. Subsequently, feature selection was performed using Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross Validation (RFECV) and the Chi-squared test. Selected parameters included age, weight, days of illness, temperature, hematocrit level, platelet count and history of vomiting as predictors of DSS. Random Under-Sampling (RUS) and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) were used to address class imbalance in the dataset. To develop predictive models, Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were trained. The results showed that SMOTE combined with XGBoost and SVM classifiers achieved the highest performance, with a 95.97% F1-score for both classifiers and an area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 98.48% for XGBoost and 98.89% for SVM classifier.

The trend of safe childbirth practices gradually increased between 2000 and 2023. Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, and its surrounding areas in the Dhaka Division showed a high number of dengue cases and deaths. The knowledge and awareness level about dengue was significantly higher for educated respondents (OR = 1.89, 1.21–1.97), residing in semi-urban regions (OR = 1.35, 0.93–1.41), female (OR = 1.39, 1.14–1.62), living in Dhaka division (OR = 3.72, 2.89–3.88), and housewife (OR = 1.52, 1.26–1.89). This initial analysis allows us to pinpoint high-risk areas and periods, facilitating targeted intervention strategies. In tandem with traditional statistical methods, we harness the power of machine learning to develop a predictive model which is capable of forecasting dengue outbreaks with enhanced accuracy. In conclusion, this study represents a comprehensive effort to deepen our understanding of dengue dynamics in Bangladesh. By combining statistical analyses with machine learning technique, we aim to provide actionable insights that can inform public health policies and interventions.

Although CNNs often outperform traditional statistical models in prediction accuracy, statistical inference, such as estimating the effects of covariates and quantifying the prediction uncertainty, is not trivial due to the highly complicated model structure and overparameterization. To address this challenge, we propose a new Bayesian approach by embedding CNNs within the generalized linear models (GLMs) framework. We use extracted nodes from the last hidden layer of CNN with Monte Carlo (MC) dropout as informative covariates in GLM. This improves accuracy in prediction and regression coefficient inference, allowing for the interpretation of coefficients and uncertainty quantification. By fitting ensemble GLMs across multiple realizations from MC dropout, we can account for uncertainties in extracting the features. We apply our methods to biological and epidemiological problems, which have both high-dimensional correlated inputs and vector covariates. Specifically, we consider malaria incidence data, brain tumor image data, and fMRI data. By extracting information from correlated inputs, the proposed method can provide an interpretable Bayesian analysis.

Existing methods for detecting, diagnosing and analyzing blood smears cannot quantify overlapped, irregular boundaries and complex structures. This work proposes and evaluates a framework that utilizes Generative adversarial networks (GANs) for the segmentation and classification of blood elements, that is, white blood cells (WBCs), red blood cells (RBCs), and platelets (PLTs) simultaneously. The Generator of the network determines the mapping from microscopic images of blood cells to a confidence map. This mapping stipulates the probabilities of the pixel of the microscopic blood cell images with respect to ground truth. The Discriminator of the network is essential to castigate the mismatch between the microscopic blood cells images and confidence map. Additionally, adversarial learning enables the Generator to generate a qualitative confidence map that is converted into segmented images. We have calculated minimum, maximum, and average losses to judge the performance of the proposed model. We measure structural similarity, peak signal-to-noise ratio, pixel classification error, and finally, classified cells. The proposed framework can analyze all the blood cell elements simultaneously. The proposed framework shows a significant improvement in the segmentation and classification of blood cell elements compared to state-of-the-art techniques. During the training process, generator total loss reduces by 12.18%, 5.39%, and 3.62% for RBCs, WBCs, and PLTs, respectively.

The gold standard for disease detection is to examine the blood smears of patients by an expert medical professional to detect malaria parasite called Plasmodium. In the rural areas of underdeveloped countries, with limited infrastructure, a scarcity of healthcare professionals, an absence of sufficient computing devices, and a lack of widespread internet access, this task becomes more challenging. A severe case of malaria can be fatal within one week, so the correct detection of the malaria parasite and its life cycle stage is crucial in treating the disease correctly.

Methods. A set of abstract images generated by a text-to-image model was developed and applied. Prompting (creating a text input) included ""polar words"" that created a visual dichotomy, positive or non-positive coloration of the images presented: e.g., ""calmness – excitement"". The following psychological techniques were used in the experiment to test correlations: Satisfaction with Life Scale, Five Well-Being Index, Questionnaire for the determination of accentuated personalities (Schmieschek), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results. The main findings are: (i) Correlations were found between preference for positive visual content in the high life satisfaction group with the “pacification and rabies” dichotomy and the “delight and despondency” dichotomy; and SWLS score with the “delight” prompt, as well as WHO5 volume (p<.05 and p<.05, respectively). (ii) When assessing the relationship between individual image dichotomies of concepts and psychological characteristics, it was revealed that 5 out of 10 personality accentuation scales were significantly correlated with the coloring of preferred generative content. Correlations were found for the visual dichotomy of “calmness and excitement” and the following personality accentuations (Schmieschek): demonstrative, hyperthymic, and dysthymic types. Conclusion. The study has demonstrated the potential use of AI-generated images in diagnosing (dis)satisfaction with life, distress, increased anxiety, as well as excitable personality traits.

It is estimated that more than 200,000 cases of malaria will occur every day worldwide, and more than 400,000 people will die from malaria. Early diagnosis of malaria is important to mitigate the morbidity and mortality of the disease. In this paper, a fully trained capsule neural network combined with a convolutional neural network model is proposed for malaria detection from blood smear microscopic images. In malaria diagnosis, the hybrid CapsNet model can detect malaria in blood samples. The hybrid model is optimized based on malaria data in microscopic images of infected and uninfected blood. Images are processed and enhanced through rotation before being fed into the hybrid CapsNet model. The CapsNet hybrid model is examined for malaria data with a learning rate of 0.07 and a batch size of 20. Hybrid CapsNet model shows improved results in detecting malaria from microscopic images measured against the currently available standard malaria test. Constraints like malaria parasite detection rate, accuracy, F1 index and blood smear classification is used to gauge the attainment of the hybrid CapsNet model. Detection rate of 99%, accuracy of 99.08% and FAR of 0.97% is attained by the hybrid CapsNet model as contrary to the traditional state-of-the-art model, the DSCN-Net, where the detection rate was 98%, the accuracy was 97.2%, and the FAR was 0.99%. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Capsule Neural Network; Convolutional Neural Network; Deep learning model; Healthcare; Malaria,,Application of hybrid capsule network model for malaria parasite detection on microscopic blood smear images,YES

Evaluating treatment outcomes in these models often requires manually counting parasite-infected red blood cells (iRBCs), a time-consuming process, which can be inconsistent between individuals and laboratories. We have developed an easy-to-use machine learning (ML)-based software, Malaria Screener R, to expedite and standardize such studies by automating the counting of Plasmodium iRBCs in rodents. This software can process Giemsa-stained blood smear images captured by any camera-equipped microscope. It features an intuitive graphical user interface that facilitates image processing and visualization of the results. The software has been developed as a desktop application that processes images on standard Windows and MacOS computers. A previous ML model created by the authors designed to count Plasmodium falciparum-infected human RBCs did not perform well counting Plasmodium-infected mouse RBCs. We leveraged that model by loading the pretrained weights and training the algorithm with newly collected data to target Plasmodium yoelii- and Plasmodium berghei-infected mouse RBCs. This new model reliably measured both P. yoelii and P. berghei parasitemia (R2 5 0.9916). Additional rounds of training data to incorporate variances due to length of Giemsa staining and type of microscopes, etc., have produced a generalizable model, meeting WHO competency level 1 for the subcategory of parasite counting using independent microscopes.

To explore the multifaceted drivers of transmission, we applied a novel framework using piecewise derivatives that incorporated singular and non-singular kernels, allowing for nuanced insights into crossover dynamics. The existence and uniqueness of solutions was demonstrated using fixed-point theory within the context of piecewise derivatives and integrals. We employed a piecewise numerical scheme grounded in Newton interpolation polynomials to approximate solutions tailored to handle singular and non-singular kernels.

Prompt and precise diagnosis, as well as preventative actions, are critical for effectively combating this condition. Malaria is now diagnosed using standard techniques. Microscopy of blood smears, which consists of small pictures, is used by trained specialists to identify diseased cells and define their life phases. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has approved this microscopy-based malaria diagnostic method. Drawing a blood sample from the finger, pricking it, spreading it onto a clean glass slide, and allowing it to dry naturally are all steps in the method. Thin blood smears were previously used to identify parasites under the microscope, but thick blood smears are utilized when parasite levels are low. OBJECTIVES: Due to its reliance on medical knowledge, high prices, time-consuming nature, and unsatisfactory outcomes, this technique has significant disadvantages. However, as deep learning algorithms progress, these activities may be completed more effectively and with fewer human resources. METHODS: This study demonstrates the usefulness of transfer learning, a type of deep learning, in categorizing microscopic pictures of parasitized versus uninfected malaria cells. Six models were evaluated using the publicly accessible NIH dataset, proving the usefulness of the suggested technique. RESULTS: VGG19 model fared better than its competitors, obtaining 95.05% accuracy, 92.83% precision, 96.88% sensitivity, 93.46% specificity, and 94.81% F1-score. CONCLUSION: This categorization of malaria cell photos will benefit microscopists in particular, as it will improve their workflow and provide a viable alternative for detecting malaria using microscopic cell images. © 2024 J.

Despite the recent development of promising vaccines against the dengue virus, controlling these arbovirus diseases still depends on mosquito surveillance and control. Nonetheless, several studies have shown that these measures are not sufficiently effective or ineffective. Identifying higher-risk areas in a municipality and directing control efforts towards them could improve it. One tool for this is the premise condition index (PCI); however, its measure requires visiting all buildings. We pro-pose a novel approach capable of predicting the PCI based on facade street-level images, which we call PCINet. Methodology Our study was conducted in Campinas, a one million-inhabitant city in São Paulo, Brazil. We surveyed 200 blocks, visited their buildings, and measured the three traditional PCI components (building and backyard conditions and shading), the facade conditions (taking pictures of them), and other characteristics. We trained a deep neural network with the pictures taken, creating a computational model that can predict buildings’ conditions based on the view of their facades. We evaluated PCINet in a scenario emulating a real large-scale situation, where the model could be deployed to automatically monitor four regions of Campinas to identify risk areas. Principal findings PCINet produced reasonable results in differentiating the facade condition into three levels, and it is a scalable strategy to triage large areas. The entire process can be automated through data collection from facade data sources and inferences through PCINet. The facade conditions correlated highly with the building and backyard conditions and reasonably well with shading and backyard conditions. The use of street-level images and PCINet could help to optimize Ae. aegypti surveillance and control, reducing the number of in-person visits necessary to identify buildings, blocks, and neighborhoods at higher risk from mosquito and arbovirus diseases. © 2024 Laranjeira et al.",,"Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2020/12371-7); Instituto Serrapilheira, (R-2011-37776); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (305188/ 2020-8, 306955/2021-0, 304391/2022-0); Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais, FAPEMIG, (APQ-00449-17); São Paulo Research Foundation-FAPESP, (2020/ 01596-8)",Automatic mapping of high-risk urban areas for Aedes aegypti infestation based on building facade image analysis,YES

Rabies is endemic in Cambodia, where no national rabies vaccination program is imple-mented. The objective of this study was to assess the short and long-term vaccination-induced immunity in Cambodian dogs under field conditions, and to propose optimized vaccination strategies. A cohort of 351 dogs was followed at regular time points following primary vaccination only (PV) or PV plus single booster (BV). Fluorescent antibody virus neutralization test (FAVNT) was implemented to determine the neutralizing antibody titer against rabies and an individual titer ≥0.5 IU/mL indicated protection. Bayesian modeling was used to evaluate the individual duration of protection against rabies and the efficacy of two different vaccination strategies. Overall, 61% of dogs had a protective immunity one year after PV. In dogs receiving a BV, this protective immunity remained for up to one year after the BV in 95% of dogs. According to the best Bayesian model, a PV conferred a protective immunity in 82% of dogs (95% CI: 75–91%) for a mean duration of 4.7 years, and BV induced a lifelong protective immunity. Annual PV of dogs less than one year old and systematic BV solely of dogs vaccinated the year before would allow to achieve the 70% World Health Organization recommended threshold to control rabies circulation in a dog population in three to five years of implementation depending on dog population dynamics. This vaccination strategy would save up to about a third of vaccine doses, reducing cost and time efforts of mass dog vaccination campaigns.

Emerging research indicates that non-pathologic changes in RBCs can also be detected in images, such as deformability and morphological changes resulting from the storage lesion. In transfusion medicine, cell deformability is a potential biomarker for the quality of donated RBCs. However, a major impediment to the clinical translation of this biomarker is the difficulty associated with performing this measurement. To address this challenge, we developed an approach for biophysical profiling of RBCs based on cell images in thin-film blood smears. We hypothesize that subtle cellular changes are evident in blood smear images, but this information is inaccessible to human expert labellers. To test this hypothesis, we developed a deep learning strategy to analyze Giemsa-stained blood smears to assess the subtle morphologies indicative of RBC deformability and storage-based degradation. Specifically, we prepared thin-film blood smears from 27 RBC samples (9 donors evaluated at 3 storage time points) and imaged them using high-resolution microscopy. Using this dataset, we trained a convolutional neural network to evaluate image-based morphological features related to cell deformability. The prediction of donor deformability is strongly correlated to the microfluidic scores and can be used to categorize images into specific deformability groups with high accuracy. We also used this model to evaluate differences in RBC morphology resulting from cold storage. Together, our results demonstrate that deep learning models can detect subtle cellular morphology differences resulting from deformability and cold storage.

In this study, we employ the NIH Malaria dataset, which consists of 27,558 images, to train a CNN model. The dataset is divided into parasitized (malaria-infected) and uninfected. The CNN architecture designed for this study includes three convolutional layers and two fully connected layers. We compare the performance of this model with that of a pre-trained VGG-16 model to determine the most effective approach for malaria diagnosis. The proposed CNN model demonstrates high accuracy, achieving a value of 96.81%. Furthermore, it records a recall of 0.97, a precision of 0.97, and an F1-score of 0.97. These metrics indicate a robust performance, outperforming previous studies and highlighting the model's potential for accurate malaria diagnosis. This study underscores the potential of CNN in medical image classification and supports its implementation in clinical settings to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

In Nepal, animal rabies has posed a significant challenge to public health. Because animals are the primary source of rabies in humans, a better understanding of rabies epidemiology in animals is necessary. The objectives of this study were to determine the correlation between rabies occurrences in dogs and livestock animals and to detect the trends and change points of the disease using longitudinal data. The nationwide rabies dataset from 2005 to 2018 was analyzed using cross-correlation, multiple change points, and time series methods. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Neural Network Autoregression (NNAR) were applied to the time series data. The results show a positive correlation between canine rabies and livestock rabies occurrences. Three significant change points were detected in the time series data, demonstrating that the occurrences were high in the initial years but stabilized before peaking to an upward trend in the final years of the study period. Nonetheless, there was no seasonality pattern in rabies occurrences. The most suitable models were ARIMA (2,1,2) and NNAR (5,1,4) (12). Based on the study findings, both locals and tourists in Nepal need to have enhanced awareness of the potential dangers posed by rabies in canines and livestock.

It is a notable concern for developing countries due to its low diagnosis rate. Dengue has the most astounding mortality level as compared to other diseases due to tremendous platelet depletion. Hence, it can be categorized as a life-threatening fever as compared to the same class of fevers. Additionally, it has been shown that dengue fever shares many of the same symptoms as other flu-based fevers. On the other hand, the research community is closely monitoring the popular research fields related to IoT, fog, and cloud computing for the diagnosis and prediction of diseases. IoT, fog, and cloud-based technologies are used for constructing a number of health care systems. Accordingly, in this study, a DengueFog monitoring system was created based on fog computing for prediction and detection of dengue sickness. Additionally, the proposed DengueFog system includes a weighted random forest (WRF) classifier to monitor and predict the dengue infection. The proposed system’s efficacy was evaluated using data on dengue infection. This dataset was gathered between 2016 and 2018 from several hospitals in the Delhi-NCR region. The accuracy, F-value, recall, precision, error rate, and specificity metrics were used to assess the simulation results of the suggested monitoring system.

In general, deep learning networks get better as more data is used to train them. For a variety of applications, convolutional neural networks are frequently used to analyse, categorize, and detect images. OBJECTIVES: The proposed system technique is used for automated analysis of malaria-detecting frameworks. A female Anopheles mosquito bite is the primary method of transmission of the blood disease malaria. It is still common to manually count and identify parasitized cells during microscopic examination of either thick or thin layers of haemoglobin, which takes time for disease prognosis. METHODS: The current research uses a neural network based on convolution to catalogue images of cells with and without malaria infection. This method improves the precision of classification for the datasets under study. The ReLu activation function used by this model enables it to learn more quickly and perform more effectively. RESULTS: The prediction of infected and healthy cells was done accurately by the proposed model, which uses only 3 layers of convolution, and this was the idea behind the implementation. The model achieved an improved accuracy of 99.77% across 12 iterations (epochs).

Nonetheless, RFFIT assay is time-consuming and it requires well-equipped biosafety level 2 facility, virulent live rabies virus cultures, permissive cell lines, and well-trained manpower. Therefore, the development of alternative methods to the RFFIT has been encouraged by the World Health Organization (WHO) expert working groups to overcome these barriers. An In-vitro ELISA test has been developed as an alternative to the RFFIT assay, for quantifying the rabies monoclonal antibody (mAb) potency using inactivated rabies virus vaccine (Rabivax-S). It is based on the specific interaction between the antigen and the antibody, that induces neutralizing antibody response to rabies virus. The ELISA was validated involving accuracy and precision within 20 % coefficient of variance. The validation has been done by 4PL standard curve with linearity r2 ˃ 0.98 and LLOQ of 0.3 μg/mL indicating high assay sensitivity. The specificity of the assay was ascertained by challenging with another homologous non-rabies humanized mAb, which does not show binding with the rabies virus. The indirect ELISA developed here, is precise, robust, and accurate to quantitate the potency of rabies monoclonal antibody. It is highly sensitive and has a broad range of detection. It is easy to perform, and it has a short turnaround time (results available in few hours). Furthermore, it is cost effective and can be performed with low-cost resource setting, as there is no requirement of handling the live cells and live virus and also BSL-2 Facility. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",indirect ELISA; potency testing; Rabies monoclonal antibodies; rabies virus,"Serum Institute of India, SII; Serum Institute of India Private Limited",Development of an ELISA for an effective potency determination of recombinant rabies human monoclonal antibody,NO

Moreover, the slide interpretation is highly dependent on the staining technique and the technician’s expertise. Therefore, there is a growing interest in next-generation, fully- or semi-integrated microscopes that can improve slide preparation and examination. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical performance of miLab™ (Noul Inc., Republic of Korea), a fully-integrated automated microscopy device for the detection of malaria parasites in symptomatic patients at point-of-care in Sudan. Methods: This was a prospective, case–control diagnostic accuracy study conducted in primary health care facilities in rural Khartoum, Sudan in 2020. According to the outcomes of routine on-site microscopy testing, 100 malaria-positive and 90 malaria-negative patients who presented at the health facility and were 5 years of age or older were enrolled consecutively. All consenting patients underwent miLab™ testing and received a negative or suspected result. For the primary analysis, the suspected results were regarded as positive (automated mode). For the secondary analysis, the operator reviewed the suspected results and categorized them as either negative or positive (corrected mode). Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used as the reference standard, and expert light microscopy as the comparator. Results: Out of the 190 patients, malaria diagnosis was confirmed by PCR in 112 and excluded in 78. The sensitivity of miLab™ was 91.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 84.2–95.6%) and the specificity was 66.7% (95% Cl 55.1–67.7%) in the automated mode. The specificity increased to 96.2% (95% Cl 89.6–99.2%), with operator intervention in the corrected mode. Concordance of miLab with expert microscopy was substantial (kappa 0.65 [95% CI 0.54–0.76]) in the automated mode, but almost perfect (kappa 0.97 [95% CI 0.95–0.99]) in the corrected mode. A mean difference of 0.359 was found in the Bland–Altman analysis of the agreement between expert microscopy and miLab™ for quantifying parasite counts. Conclusion: When used in a clinical context, miLab™ demonstrated high sensitivity but low specificity. Expert intervention was shown to be required to improve the device’s specificity in its current version. miLab™ in the corrected mode performed similar to expert microscopy. Before clinical application, more refinement is needed to ensure full workflow automation and eliminate human intervention.

This study aims to explore the utility of host inflammatory mediators and neurofilament (NfL) levels in distinguishing etiologies, assessing disease severity, and predicting outcomes in AES. We assessed 12 mediators in serum (n = 58) and 11 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (n = 42) from 62 children with AES due to scrub typhus, viral etiologies, and COVID-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) in Southern India. Additionally, NfL levels in serum (n = 20) and CSF (n = 18) were examined. Clinical data, including Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and Liverpool outcome scores, were recorded. Examining serum and CSF markers in the three AES etiology groups revealed notable distinctions, with scrub typhus differing significantly from viral and MIS-C causes. Viral causes had elevated serum CCL11 and CCL2 compared with scrub typhus, while MIS-C cases showed higher HGF levels than scrub typhus. However, CSF analysis showed a distinct pattern with the scrub typhus group exhibiting elevated levels of IL-1RA, IL-1β, and TNF compared with MIS-C, and lower CCL2 levels compared with the viral group. Modeling the characteristic features, we identified that age ≥3 years with serum CCL11 < 180 pg/mL effectively distinguished scrub typhus from other AES causes. Elevated serum CCL11, HGF, and IL-6:IL-10 ratio were associated with poor outcomes (p = 0.038, 0.005, 0.02). Positive CSF and serum NfL correlation, and negative GCS and serum NfL correlation were observed. Median NfL levels were higher in children with abnormal admission GCS and poor outcomes. Measuring immune mediators and brain injury markers in AES provides valuable diagnostic insights, with the potential to facilitate rapid diagnosis and prognosis. The correlation between CSF and serum NfL, along with distinctive serum cytokine profiles across various etiologies, indicates the adequacy of blood samples alone for assessment and monitoring. The association of elevated levels of CCL11, HGF, and an increased IL-6:IL-10 ratio with adverse outcomes suggests promising avenues for therapeutic exploration, warranting further investigation. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",acute encephalitis syndrome; chemokines; COVID-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome; cytokines; inflammatory markers; neurofilament,"Public Health England, PHE; University of Liverpool, UoL; Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DBT; University of Oxford; HPRU; UK Research and Innovation, UKRI; Medical Research Council, MRC, (MR/V03605X/1, MR/T028750/1, MR/V007181/1, MC_PC_19059); Medical Research Council, MRC; National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit, NIHR HPRU, (NIHR200907); National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit, NIHR HPRU; Wellcome Trust DBT India Alliance, WTDBT India Alliance, (IA/E/15/1/503960); Wellcome Trust DBT India Alliance, WTDBT India Alliance; Wellcome Trust, WT, (ISSF201902/3); Wellcome Trust, WT; National Institute for Health and Care Research, NIHR, (CO‐CIN‐01); National Institute for Health and Care Research, NIHR; Medical Research Foundation, MRF, (MRF‐CPP‐R2‐2022‐100003); Medical Research Foundation, MRF; Indian Council of Medical Research, ICMR, (2021‐3668); Indian Council of Medical Research, ICMR",Diagnostic markers of acute encephalitis syndrome and COVID-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children from Southern India,NO

2024.0,diagnosis,"Computer Engineering and Systems Dept., Faculty of Engineering, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt","Background: In recent years, Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) has become an important research area that attracted a lot of researchers. In medical diagnostic systems, several attempts have been made to build and enhance CAD applications to avoid errors that can cause dangerously misleading medical treatments. The most exciting opportunity for promoting the performance of CAD system can be accomplished by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medicine. This allows the effective automation of traditional manual workflow, which is slow, inaccurate and affected by human errors. Aims: This paper aims to provide a complete Computer Aided Disease Diagnosis (CAD2) strategy based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques that can help clinicians to make better medical decisions. Methods: The proposed CAD2 consists of three main sequential phases, namely; (i) Outlier Rejection Phase (ORP), (ii) Feature Selection Phase (FSP), and (iii) Classification Phase (CP). ORP is implemented to reject outliers using new Outlier Rejection Technique (ORT) that contains two sequential stages called Fast Outlier Rejection (FOR) and Accurate Outlier Rejection (AOR). The most informative features are selected through FSP using Hybrid Selection Technique (HST). HST includes two main stages called Quick Selection Stage (QS2) using fisher score as a filter method and Precise Selection Stage (PS2) using a Hybrid Bio-inspired Optimization (HBO) technique as a wrapper method. Finally, actual diagnose takes place through CP, which relies on Ensemble Classification Technique (ECT). Results: The proposed CAD2 has been tested experimentally against recent disease diagnostic strategies using two different datasets in which the first contains several diseases, while the second includes data for Covid-19 patients only. Experimental results have proven the high efficiency of the proposed CAD2 in terms of accuracy, error, precision, and recall compared with other competitors. Additionally, CAD2 strategy provides the best Wilcoxon signed rank test and Friedman test measurements against other strategies according to both datasets. Conclusion: It is concluded that CAD2 strategy based on ORP, FSP, and CP gave an accurate diagnosis compared to other strategies because it gave the highest accuracy and the lowest error and implementation time. © 2023",Computer-aided diagnoses; Diagnosis; Diseases; Ensemble classification; Feature selection; Outlier rejection,,Diseases diagnosis based on artificial intelligence and ensemble classification,YES

The lack of standardized benchmarking complicates software selection, especially with limited resources. Methods: We developed a containerized benchmarking pipeline to evaluate seven long-read assemblers—Canu, GoldRush, MetaFlye, Strainline, HaploDMF, iGDA, and RVHaplo—for viral haplotype reconstruction, using both simulated and experimental Oxford Nanopore sequencing data of HIV-1 and other viruses. Benchmarking was conducted on three computational systems to assess each assembler’s performance, utilizing QUAST and BLASTN for quality assessment. Results: Our findings show that assembler choice significantly impacts assembly time, with CPU and memory usage having minimal effect. Assembler selection also influences the size of the contigs, with a minimum read length of 2,000 nucleotides required for quality assembly. A 4,000-nucleotide read length improves quality further. Canu was efficient among de novo assemblers but not suitable for multi-strain mixtures, while GoldRush produced only consensus assemblies. Strainline and MetaFlye were suitable for metagenomic sequencing data, with Strainline requiring high memory and MetaFlye operable on low-specification machines. Among reference-based assemblers, iGDA had high error rates, RVHaplo showed the best runtime and accuracy but became ineffective with similar sequences, and HaploDMF, utilizing machine learning, had fewer errors with a slightly longer runtime. Conclusions: The HIV-64148 pipeline, containerized using Docker, facilitates easy deployment and offers flexibility to select from a range of assemblers to match computational systems or study requirements. This tool aids in genome assembly and provides valuable information on HIV-1 sequences, enhancing viral evolution monitoring and understanding.

We conducted a study in pregnant women living in a malaria endemic area to determine the potential effect of gestational age on the modulation of the endocrine system by cortisol and prolactin production during pregnancy. Methods Primigravidae and multigravidae with a gestational age between 16–20 weeks were included in the study and followed up to delivery and 6–7 weeks thereafter. Venous blood was collected at scheduled visit: Visit 1 (V1; 16–20 weeks of amenorrhea), Visit 2 (V2; 28 ±1 weeks of pregnancy), Visit 3 (V3; 32 ±1 weeks of pregnancy), Visit4 (V4; delivery) and Visit5 (V5; 6–7 weeks after delivery). In addition, a cord blood sample was also collected during labour at delivery. Nulliparous and primiparous/multiparous non-pregnant women were enrolled in the control group. Cortisol and prolactin plasma concentrations were measured using ichroma II and i-chamber apparatus. Light microscopy was used to detect Plasmodium falciparum infections. A linear mixed-effects regression (LMER) model was used to assess the association between the variation of cortisol titres and prolactin levels during the pregnancy and the post-partum. Results Results showed that cortisol and prolactin levels in the peripheral blood were globally up-regulated during pregnancy. Concentrations of cortisol during follow-up was significantly higher in primigravidae than in multigravidae during the whole pregnancy (p<0.024). Moreover, the level of prolactin which was higher before delivery in primigravidae reversed at delivery and postpartum visit, but the difference was not statistically significant during the follow-up (V1 to V5) (p = 0.60). The cortisol level in peripheral blood at delivery was higher than that in the cord blood, and conversely for prolactin. Cortisol and prolactin levels decreased after delivery, though the level of prolactin was still higher than that at enrolment. An increase of one unit of prolactin was associated with the decrease of the average concentration of cortisol by 0.04 ng/ml (p = 0.009). However, when cortisol increases with one unit, the average concentration of prolactin decreases by 1.16 ng/ml (p = 0.013). Conclusion These results showed that the up-regulation effects of cortisol and prolactin are related to gestational age. A The downward regulation effect that both hormones have on each other during the pregnancy when each increase to 1 unit (1.0 ng/ml) was also reported. © 2024 Kiemde et al.

While precise early detection is crucial, conventional techniques like microscopy require substantial time and accuracy. This work rigorously examines recent developments in STH detection utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques. This study pertains to articles published from 2014 until 2024. During the literature selection process utilizing the PRISMA Method, 26 pertinent articles were extracted from the Google Scholar, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus databases. The findings indicated that notably Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and U-Net algorithms exhibited markedly superior detection accuracy (95-98%) relative to Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) (87-92%) respectively. SVM and RF exhibit superior speed but diminished accuracy when applied to tiny datasets. Moreover, there exists significant potential to boost model performance and address data constraints using transfer learning and data augmentation techniques. This study demonstrates that the integration of artificial intelligence with the Internet of Things (IoT) facilitates expedited and more efficient surveillance through real-time detection of STH in endemic regions. Moreover, crowdsourcing and self-supervised learning (SSL) have emerged as methods for the acquisition of annotated data. Significant recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning technologies forecast expedited, more precise, and scalable STH diagnosis in the future.

Therefore, the development of technological tools such as machine learning (ML) offers an opportunity to innovate strategies for improving the diagnosis of this complex disease. Objective: To validate the utility of different ML models for the histopathological diagnosis of Hansen disease. Methodology: An observational study was conducted where 55 H&E-stained tissue slides from leprosy patients and 51 healthy skin controls were analyzed using microphotographs captured at various magnifications. These images were categorized based on histopathological findings and processed using the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining methodology for designing and training ML models. Five types of ML models were evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, emphasizing data normalization as a fundamental step in optimizing model performance. Results: The artificial neural network (ANN) model demonstrated an accuracy of 70%, sensitivity of 74%, and specificity of 65%, demonstrating its ability to identify leprosy cases with moderate precision. The receiver operating characteristic curve of the ANN model showed an area under the curve of 0.71. Conversely, models such as decision trees, logistic regression, and random forests showed similar accuracy results but with slightly lower sensitivity, potentially indicating a higher risk of false negatives in detecting leprosy-positive cases. Conclusion: The ANN model emerges as a promising alternative for leprosy detection. However, further refinement of these models is necessary to enhance their adaptability across different clinical settings and participation in patient care.

Using spatial genetic inference, we identify a potential signal of common dispersal patterns in the Anopheles gambiae and Plasmodium falciparum host–parasite system as seen through a between-species correlation of the differences between geographic sampling location and geographic location predicted from the genome. This correlation may be due to coupled dispersal dynamics between host and parasite but may also reflect statistical artifacts due to uneven spatial distribution of sampling locations. Using continuous-space population genetics simulations, we investigate the degree to which uneven distribution of sampling locations leads to bias in prediction of spatial location from genetic data and implement methods to counter this effect. We demonstrate that while algorithmic bias presents a problem in inference from spatio-genetic data, the correlation structure between A. gambiae and P. falciparum predictions cannot be attributed to spatial bias alone and is thus likely a genetic signal of co-dispersal in a host–parasite system. © 2024 Genetics Society of America.

Estimating parasitemia is essential in determining the severity of the Plasmodium falciparum infection and guiding treatment. However, this process is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subject to variation, which can directly affect patient outcomes. In this retrospective study, we compared three methods for measuring parasitemia from a collection of anonymized thin blood smears of patients with Plasmodium falciparum obtained from the Clinical Department of Parasitology-Mycology, National Reference Center (NRC) for Malaria in Paris, France. We first analyzed the impact of the number of field images on parasitemia count using our framework, MALARIS, which features a top-classifier convolutional neural network (CNN).

Detection of an active glomerular injury is important to identify early renal damage and to prevent the development of chronic kidney disease. Podocyturia can indicate renal injury, and podocyte-associated molecules such as podocin and nephrin can be used to identify podocyturia. The purpose of the study was to evaluate urinary podocin and nephrin concentrations in dogs with leishmaniosis as markers of podocyturia. Methods: A total of 35 healthy dogs and 37 dogs with leishmaniosis were enrolled in the study. Dogs with leishmaniosis were classified according to the staging of the International Renal Interest Society (IRIS). Urinary podocin and nephrin concentrations were measured in all dogs with a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test and normalized to creatinine (uPoC and uNeC, respectively). The demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from both groups were analyzed and compared. Subsequently, the laboratory results were analyzed and compared according to IRIS staging in dogs in IRIS stage I and dogs in IRIS stage II + III + IV. The Pearson’s correlation test evaluated the relationship between urinary markers of podocyturia. Results: Compared with healthy dogs, lower urinary podocin [median values (IQR): 15.10 (11.75–17.87) ng/ml versus 8.63 (7.08–13.56) ng/ml; P < 0.01] and nephrin [median values (IQR): 3.2 (3.62–5.43) ng/ml versus 2.67 (2.06–3.44) ng/ml; P < 0.01] were found in infected sick dogs. No significant differences were observed in the uPoC and uNeC between the two groups. Urinary nephrin and podocin concentrations were higher in healthy dogs and in dogs in IRIS stage I (both P < 0.05) compared with dogs in IRIS stages II + III + IV. No significant differences were found for uPoC and uNeC between healthy dogs and dogs with leishmaniosis in different IRIS clinical stages. Conclusions: Dogs with leishmaniosis had a low concentration of podocin and nephrin in more advanced IRIS clinical stages, when kidney disease was more severe compared with healthy dogs and dogs in IRIS stage I with mild disease. Urinary nephrin was detectable for the first time in healthy non-infected dogs.

To improve this, machine learning models for predicting malaria, focusing on high-risk areas, have been developed. Methods: The study targeted the northern region of ROK, near the demilitarized zone, using a 1-km grid to identify areas for prediction. Grid cells without residential buildings were excluded, leaving 8,425 cells. The prediction was based on whether at least one malaria case was reported in each grid cell per month, using spatial data of patient locations. Four algorithms were used: gradient boosted (GBM), generalized linear (GLM), extreme gradient boosted (XGB), and ensemble models, incorporating environmental, sociodemographic, and meteorological data as predictors. The models were trained with data from May to October (2019–2021) and tested with data from May to October 2022. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results: The AUROC of the prediction models performed excellently (GBM = 0.9243, GLM = 0.9060, XGB = 0.9180, and ensemble model = 0.9301). Previous malaria risk, population size, and meteorological factors influenced the model most in GBM and XGB.

As a result, understanding immunologic variation across individuals in response to vaccination is important for developing next-generation efficacious vaccines. Accurate outcome prediction and identification of predictive biomarkers would represent a significant step towards this goal. Moreover, in early phase vaccine clinical trials, small datasets are prevalent, raising the need and challenge of building a robust and explainable prediction model that can reveal heterogeneity in small datasets. We propose a new model named Generative Mixture of Logistic Regression (GeM-LR), which combines characteristics of both a generative and a discriminative model. In addition, we propose a set of model selection strategies to enhance the robustness and interpretability of the model. GeM-LR extends a linear classifier to a non-linear classifier without losing interpretability and empowers the notion of predictive clustering for characterizing data heterogeneity in connection with the outcome variable. We demonstrate the strengths and utility of GeM-LR by applying it to data from several studies. GeM-LR achieves better prediction results than other popular methods while providing interpretations at different levels. Copyright: © 2024 Lin et al.

However, GWR is typically limited to the analysis of continuous dependent variables, which are assumed to follow a symmetric normal distribution. In many fields, nonnegative continuous data are often observed and may contain substantial amounts of zeros followed by a right-skewed distribution of positive values. When dealing with such type of outcomes, GWR may not provide adequate insights into spatially varying regression relationships. This study intends to extend the GWR based on a compound Poisson distribution. Such an extension not only allows for exploration of relationship heterogeneity but also accommodates nonnegative continuous response variables.

Unlike classical CAD systems, leprosy detection and classification has remained a least explored research area. Invasive and chemical assay-based leprosy detection approaches are often found time-consuming, complex, and limited to cope-up with real-world’s demand. Though, in the last few years every effort has been made towards vision-based leprosy detection and classification; however, limited data, inferior feature, high-annotation demands, and importantly low accuracy limit their suitability. Considering these facts as motivation, in this paper a highly robust Heuristic Driven Segmentation assisted hybrid deep-spatio-textural feature learning for leprosy detection and classification is developed. It emphasizes on both region of interest segmentation and its optimization, as well as feature improvement to achieve higher accuracy and reliability. Here, firefly heuristic driven Fuzzy C-Means clustering (FFCM) was developed to perform ROI specific segmentation, which was followed by a hybrid deep spatio-textural feature extraction process. Noticeably, FFCM at one hand enabled automatic and accurate ROI-segmentation. On the contrary, the use of hybrid features including descriptive spatio-textural textural statistics (i.e., Gray-level co-occurrence metrics) and 4096-dimensional AlexNet features provided an intrinsic feature rich vector to perform accurate leprosy classification. The ROI-specific hybrid features (i.e., GLCM and AlexNet features) were processed for two-class classification using ensemble random forest classifier that labelled each input skin lesion as the normal image or the leprosy detected. The proposed leprosy detection method exhibited superior performance (accuracy = 96.6%, precision = 99.7%, recall = 95.8%, F-score = 0.9771) over other state-of-art methods like GLCM (accuracy = 88.51%) and Convolutional Neural Network based methods (91%).

Transcriptomics has been used to evaluate immune responses during malaria in diverse cohorts worldwide. However, the high heterogeneity of cohorts and poor generalization of transcriptional signatures reported in each study limit their potential clinical applications. Methods. We compiled 28 public data sets containing 1556 whole-blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cell transcriptome samples. We estimated effect sizes with Hedge’s g value and the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model for meta-analyses of uncomplicated malaria. Random forest models identified gene signatures that discriminate malaria from bacterial infections or malaria severity. Parasitological, hematological, immunological, and metabolomics data were used for validation. Results. We identified 3 gene signatures: the uncomplicated Malaria Meta-Signature, which discriminates Plasmodium falciparum malaria from uninfected controls; the Malaria or Bacteria Signature, which distinguishes malaria from sepsis and enteric fever; and the cerebral Malaria Meta-Signature, which characterizes individuals with cerebral malaria. These signatures correlate with clinical hallmark features of malaria. Blood transcription modules indicate immune regulation by glucocorticoids, whereas cell development and adhesion are associated with cerebral malaria. Conclusions.

These diseases are caused by a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites, and are a significant global public health concern. Vector-borne diseases are prevalent in many parts of the world, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions, where the vectors thrive. This research has contributed by constructing a hybrid machine learning based prediction model, which helps to discover patients who are infected by vector-borne disease at an earlier stage and also helps with the categorization and diagnosis of severe vector-borne disease. The model that has been proposed is made up of units: data conversion, data preprocessing, normalization, extraction of feature, splitting of dataset, and classification and prediction unit. The fact that the suggested prediction model is capable of identifying vector-borne disease in its early phases as well as categorizing the kind of disease using the medical report of a sufferer is one of the innovative aspects of the model. The 7 distinct conventional machine learning and single hybrid machine learning (HML) are applied for classification and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based reinforcement learning are utilized for recommendation. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the system that’s been proposed, a number of tests were carried out. A dataset consisting of 1539 different cases of a disease transmitted by vectors has been collected. The 11 common vector-borne diseases namely malaria, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, kala-azar and chikungunya were taken for experimental evaluation. The performance accuracy of the proposed prediction model has been measured at 98.76%, which assists the healthcare team in making decisions on a timely basis and ultimately helps to save the patient’s lives.

Candidate immune-related genes were then screened and identified by the random forest model and the eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm. Finally, four hub genes, namely, CSF3R, EED, HSPA1B, and IL17RA, were obtained and used to establish the nomogram model. The receiver operating curve, the area under curve, and the calibration curve were all used to validate the accuracy and usefulness of the diagnostic model. Immune cell infiltrating was examined, and CAD patients were then divided into high- and low-expression groups for further gene set enrichment analysis. Through targeting the hub genes, we also found potential drugs for anti-CAD treatment by using the molecular docking method. Conclusions: CSF3R, EED, HSPA1B, and IL17RA are potential diagnostic biomarkers for CAD. CAD pathogenesis is greatly influenced by patterns of immune cell infiltration. Promising drugs offers new prospects for the development of CAD therapy.

This study aims to identify hub genes involved in this process. We utilized machine learning, GO, KEGG, GSEA, Single-cell analysis, ROC methods to identify hub genes for bone metastasis in PCa using the TCGA and GEO databases. Potential drugs targeting these genes were identified. We validated these results using 16 specimens from patients with PCa and analysed the relationship between the hub genes and clinical features. The impact of APOC1 on PCa was assessed through in vitro experiments. Seven hub genes with AUC values of 0.727–0.926 were identified. APOC1, CFH, NUSAP1 and LGALS1 were highly expressed in bone metastasis tissues, while NR4A2, ADRB2 and ZNF331 exhibited an opposite trend. Immunohistochemistry further confirmed these results. The oxidative phosphorylation pathway was significantly enriched by the identified genes. Aflatoxin B1, benzo(a)pyrene, cyclosporine were identified as potential drugs. APOC1 expression was correlated with clinical features of PCa metastasis. Silencing APOC1 significantly inhibited PCa cell proliferation, clonality, and migration in vitro.

As part of national efforts to eliminate gHAT as a public health problem, Uganda implemented a large-scale programme of deploying Tiny Targets, which comprise panels of insecticide-treated material which attract and kill tsetse. At its peak, the programme was the largest tsetse control operation in Africa. Here, we quantify the impact of Tiny Targets and environmental changes on the spatial and temporal patterns of tsetse abundance across North-Western Uganda. Methods We leverage a 100-month longitudinal dataset detailing Glossina fuscipes fuscipes catches from monitoring traps between October 2010 and December 2019 within seven districts in North-Western Uganda. We fitted a boosted regression tree (BRT) model assessing environmental suitability, which was used alongside Tiny Target data to fit a spatiotemporal geostatistical model predicting tsetse abundance across our study area (∼16 000 km 2). We used the spatiotemporal model to quantify the impact of Tiny Targets and environmental changes on the distribution of tsetse, alongside metrics of uncertainty. Results Environmental suitability across the study area remained relatively constant over time, with suitability being driven largely by elevation and distance to rivers. By performing a counterfactual analysis using the fitted spatiotemporal geostatistical model, we show that deployment of Tiny Targets across an area of 4000 km 2 reduced the overall abundance of tsetse to low levels (median daily catch=1.1 tsetse/trap, IQR=0.85-1.28). No spatial-temporal locations had high (>10 tsetse/trap/day) numbers of tsetse compared with 18% of locations for the counterfactual. Conclusions In Uganda, Tiny Targets reduced the abundance of G. f. fuscipes and maintained tsetse populations at low levels. Our model represents the first spatiotemporal geostatistical model investigating the effects of a national tsetse control programme.

This study aimed to investigate the therapy-induced genomic changes and immune microenvironment alteration in patients with aOC. Materials and methods: The microarray data of ovarian cancer samples from naïve or treated patients were collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between samples were screened. Consensus clustering was conducted to explore the molecular subtypes of ovarian cancer samples. The correlation between tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) signatures with the molecular subtypes was subject to Gene set variation analysis (GSVA). The prognostic signature of aOC was constructed using machine learning based on lasso-cox regression. Finally, immune infiltration analysis was performed for immune landscape evaluation in aOC. Results: Totally 28 DEGs were found between the control and treatment groups. Enrichment analysis indicated the association of these genes with the immune changes. Moreover, the cluster 1/2 (C1/C2) of ovarian cancer were identified, and the C1 subtype had higher enrichment of TLS-related biomarkers. Moreover, 15 genes were revealed as independent factors for the prediction of ovarian cancer prognosis. Immune infiltration levels were significantly higher in the C1 subtype, which indicated the distinct immune landscape between the two molecular subtypes of ovarian cancer. Conclusion: The NACT and CRS induced genomic changes were related to immune response in aOC.

Methods: Microarray and RNA-sequencing datasets (GSE47184, GSE96804, GSE104948, GSE104954, GSE142025 and GSE175759) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differential expression analysis identified the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between patients with DN and controls. Diverse machine learning algorithms, including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination, and random forest, were used to enhance gene selection accuracy and predictive power. We integrated summary-level data from genome-wide association studies on DN with expression quantitative trait loci data to identify genes with potential causal relationships to DN. The predictive performance of the biomarker gene was validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Gene set enrichment and correlation analyses were conducted to investigate potential mechanisms. Finally, the biomarker gene was validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in clinical samples from patients with DN and controls. Results: Based on identified 314 DEGs, seven characteristic genes with high predictive performance were identified using three integrated machine learning algorithms. MR analysis revealed 219 genes with significant causal effects on DN, ultimately identifying one co-expressed gene, carbonic anhydrase II (CA2), as a key biomarker for DN. The ROC curves demonstrated the excellent predictive performance of CA2, with area under the curve values consistently above 0.878 across all datasets. Additionally, our analysis indicated a significant association between CA2 and infiltrating immune cells in DN, providing potential mechanistic insights. This biomarker was validated using clinical samples, confirming the reliability of our findings in clinical practice. Conclusion: By integrating machine learning, MR and experimental validation, we successfully identified and validated CA2 as a promising biomarker for DN with excellent predictive performance.

For example, autoantibody biomarkers have poor sensitivity or specificity in systemic lupus erythematosus and do not exist in the spondyloarthropathies, impairing diagnosis and treatment. While autoantibodies suitable for strong biomarkers may not exist in these conditions, another possibility is that technology has limited their discovery. The purpose of this study was to use a novel high-density peptide array that enables the evaluation of IgG binding to every possible linear antigen in the entire human peptidome, as well as a novel machine learning approach that incorporates ELISA validation predictability in order to discover autoantibodies that could be developed into sensitive and specific markers of lupus or spondyloarthropathy. Methods: We used a peptide array containing the human peptidome, several viral peptidomes, and key post-translational modifications (6 million peptides) to quantify IgG binding in lupus, spondyloarthropathy, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren’s disease, and control sera. Using ELISA data for 70 peptides, we performed a random forest analysis that evaluated multiple array features to predict which peptides might be good biomarkers, as confirmed by ELISA. We validated the peptide prediction methodology in rheumatoid arthritis and COVID-19, conditions for which the antibody repertoire is well-understood, and then evaluated IgG binding by ELISA to peptides that we predicted would be highly bound specifically in lupus or spondyloarthropathy. Results: Our methodology performed well in validation studies, but peptides predicted to be highly and specifically bound in lupus or spondyloarthropathy could not be confirmed by ELISA. Conclusions: In a comprehensive evaluation of the entire human peptidome, highly sensitive and specific IgG autoantibodies were not identified in lupus or spondyloarthropathy. Thus, the pathogenesis of lupus and spondyloarthropathy may not depend upon unique autoantigens, and other types of molecules should be sought as optimal biomarkers in these conditions. © 2024 by the authors.",antibody; autoantibody; biomarker; peptide array; spondyloarthropathy; systemic lupus erythematosus,"University of Wisconsin-Madison, UW; U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, USAMRAA; Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, WARF; National Institutes of Health, NIH; Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, CDMRP, (W81XWH-18-1-0717); Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, CDMRP; MSTP, (T32 GM140935); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS, (UL1TR002373, KL2TR002374); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI, (T32 HL007899); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (T32 AG000213); National Institute on Aging, NIA",Limited Biomarker Potential for IgG Autoantibodies Reactive to Linear Epitopes in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus or Spondyloarthropathy,YES

To slow the spread of resistance, it is essential to develop and evaluate new formulations that feature unique modes of action and extended residual effects. Addressing this need, Mitsui Chemicals Crop & Life Solutions, Inc., developed VECTRON™ T500, a new indoor residual spraying (IRS) formulation using broflanilide, applied at a dosage of 100 mg AI/m2. This formulation was tested in a Phase III community trial, alongside Actellic® 300CS, a commonly used IRS product containing pirimiphos-methyl, applied at the recommended dosage of 1000 mg AI/m2. Methods: Monthly WHO wall cone bioassays were performed to assess the efficacy of the interventions using three mosquito strains: the laboratory-bred, insecticide-susceptible Anopheles gambiae s.s. Kisumu strain, the insecticide-resistant Anopheles coluzzii VKPer strain, and wild Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes from the Vallée du Kou, where the study was conducted. Vector surveillance was carried out to compare the results between sites treated with VECTRON™ T500, Actellic® 300CS, and an untreated control site. In addition, any reported adverse effects were closely monitored to evaluate the community’s acceptance of VECTRON™ T500. Results: VECTRON™ T500 consistently achieved 100% mortality across all wall types for both susceptible and resistant mosquito strains over the 12-month period. In comparison, Actellic® 300CS induced < 80% mortality for both strains, irrespective of the wall substrate. When assessing delayed mortality in An. gambiae s.l. mosquitoes collected from sites treated with Actellic® 300CS (VK1) and VECTRON™ T500 (VK3), a statistically significant difference was noted after a 72-h holding period compared to the control site (RR = 0.51, CI95% = [0.31–0.6], P = 0.0026). Additionally, no adverse events were reported in households sprayed with VECTRON™ T500. Conclusions: The residual efficacy of VECTRON™ T500 extended for 12 months post-spraying, effectively covering the full malaria transmission season while maintaining high mortality rates in pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors. VECTRON™ T500 demonstrated non-inferiority in performance compared to Actellic® 300CS, the standard reference product.

Additionally, it evaluates the impact of seasonal and meteorological factors on the epidemiology of influenza and malaria to ascertain the model's efficacy in predicting incidence rates and trends. The findings indicate that the peak period for influenza incidence typically occurs during the transition from winter to spring, specifically between weeks 2 and 14. The correlation coefficients between temperature variables and malaria incidence generally ranged from 0.7 to 0.9. The ARMA-BP model demonstrated robust short-term predictive capabilities for influenza, showing a high degree of concordance in predictions for 2021 and 2022, though it performed less satisfactorily for 2023. For malaria, the predicted and actual incidence trends were largely consistent, with prediction errors consistently below 0.01.

The model predictions also revealed a substantial underestimation of the current sandfly distribution and VL risk. The predicted areas affected by the 12 major species of sandflies and the high-risk areas for VL were found to be 37.9–1121.0% and 136.6% larger, respectively, than the observed range in the areas. The future global changes were projected to decrease the risk of mountain-type zoonotic VL (MT-ZVL), but anthroponotic VL (AVL) and desert-type zoonotic VL (DT-ZVL) could remain stable or slightly increase. Conclusions Current field observations underestimate the spatial distributions of main sandfly species and VL in China. More active surveillance and field investigations are needed where high risks are predicted, especially in areas where the future risk of VL is projected to remain high or increase. © 2024 Hong et al.",,"China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists, (81825019); China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFC2302004); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC",Mapping the distribution of sandflies and sandfly-associated pathogens in China,YES

The model explores the patterns and behaviors of dengue fever in Bangladesh. Incorporating a sinusoidal function reveals significant mid-May to Late October outbreak predictions, aligning with the government's exposed data in our simulation. For different amplitudes (A) within a sequence of values (A = 0.1 to 0.5), the highest number of infected mosquitoes occurs in July. However, simulations project that when βM = 0.5 and A = 0.1, the peak of human infections occurs in late September. Not only the next-generation matrix approach along with the stability of disease-free and endemic equilibrium points are observed, but also a cutting-edge Machine learning (ML) approach such as the Prophet model is explored for forecasting future Dengue outbreaks in Bangladesh. Remarkably, we have fitted our solution curve of infection with the reported data by the government of Bangladesh.

Due to advancements in the malaria diagnostic process, microscopy techniques are employed for blood cell analysis. Unfortunately, the diagnostic process of malaria via microscopy depends on microscopic skills. To overcome such issues, machine/deep learning algorithms can be proposed for more accurate and efficient detection of malaria. Therefore, a method is proposed for classifying malaria parasites that consist of three phases. The bilateral filter is applied to enhance image quality. After that shape-based and deep features are extracted. In shape-based pyramid histograms of oriented gradients (PHOG) features are derived with the dimension of N × 300. Deep features are derived from the residual network (ResNet)-50, and ResNet-18 at fully connected layers having the dimension of N × 1, 000 respectively. The features obtained are fused serially, resulting in a dimensionality of N × 2, 300. From this set, N × 498 features are chosen using the generalized normal distribution optimization (GNDO) method. The proposed method is accessed on a microscopic malarial parasite imaging dataset providing 99% classification accuracy which is better than as compared to recently published work.

Despite progress in immunotherapies that could delay T1D onset, early detection of autoimmunity remains challenging. Here, we evaluate the utility of machine learning for early prediction of T1D using single-cell analysis of islets. Using gradient-boosting algorithms, we model changes in gene expression of single cells from pancreatic tissues in T1D and non-diabetic organ donors. We assess if mathematical modeling could predict the likelihood of T1D development in non-diabetic autoantibody-positive donors. While most autoantibody-positive donors are predicted to be non-diabetic, select donors with unique gene signatures are classified as T1D. Our strategy also reveals a shared gene signature in distinct T1D-associated models across cell types, suggesting a common effect of the disease on transcriptional outputs of these cells.

In particular, commonly used devices such as the Rapid Diagnosis Test (RDT) are not completely dependable. They are primarily notable for their failure to provide adequate medical treatment and their tendency to diagnose the disease late and incorrectly. For example, widely used devices like the RDT are not consistent.

The PNDHS data consist of two levels: level-1 represents within-household data (household questionnaire), and level-2 represents between-household data (primary sampling unit (PSU)). Therefore, a two-level CFA and two-level variance CFA were performed. Furthermore, a multigroup analysis assessed the structural differences between males/females and urban/rural groups. In the PNDHS survey, 30,372 household interviews were completed. Knowledge levels for cancer, heart disease, diabetes, dengue fever, TB, and COVID-19 were 96.7%, 94.9%, 97.8%, 98.4%, 96.7%, and 92.8%, respectively. The two-level CFA indicated that the coefficient loadings of each item for both levels were statistically significant (Z-test, P < 0.001). Regarding two-level variance CFA, the variance at level-1 was higher than that at level-2 (13 and 6.7, respectively).

The engineered construct includes two genes that encode anti-Plasmodium peptides, along with a Cas9-based gene drive. We investigated gene flow among A. coluzzii subpopulations on each island to estimate dispersal rates between sites. Sampling covered the known range of A. coluzzii on both islands. Spatial autocorrelation suggests 7 km to be the likely extent of dispersal of this species, whereas estimates based on a convolutional neural network were roughly 3 km. This difference highlights the complexity of dispersal dynamics and the value of using multiple approaches. Our analysis also revealed weak heterogeneity among populations within each island but did identify areas weakly resistant or permissive of gene flow.

Approximately half of the world's population is considered at risk of infection, predominantly in African and South Asian countries. Although malaria is preventable, heterogeneity in sociodemographic and environmental risk factors over time and across diverse geographical and climatological regions make outbreak prediction challenging. Data-driven approaches accounting for spatiotemporal variability could offer potential for location-specific early warning tools for malaria. METHODS: In this case study, we developed and internally validated a data fusion approach to predict malaria incidence in Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh using geo-referenced environmental factors. For 2000-17, district-level malaria incidence rates for each country were obtained from the US Agency for International Development's Demographic and Health Survey datasets. Environmental factors included average annual temperature, rainfall, and normalised difference vegetation index, obtained from the Advancing Research on Nutrition and Agriculture (known as AReNA) project conducted by the International Food Policy Research Institute in 2020. Data on night-time light intensity was derived from two satellites of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System: Nighttime Lights Time Series Version 4, and VIIRS Nighttime Day/Night Band Composites version 1. A multi-dimensional spatiotemporal long short-term memory (M-LSTM) model was developed using data from 2000-16 and internally validated for the year 2017. The M-LSTM model consisted of four hidden layers, each with 100 LSTM units; a fully connected layer was used, followed by linear regression, to predict the malaria incidence rate for 2017 using spatiotemporal partitioning. Model performance was measured using accuracy and root mean squared error. Country-specific models were produced for Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Bivariate geospatial heatmaps were produced for a qualitative comparison of univariate environmental factors with malaria rates. FINDINGS: Malaria incidence was predicted with 80·6% accuracy in districts across Pakistan, 76·7% in districts across India, and 99·1% in districts across Bangladesh. The root mean squared error was 7 × 10-4 for Pakistan, 4·86 × 10-6 for India, and 1·32 × 10-5 for Bangladesh. Bivariate maps showed an inverse relationship between night-time lights and malaria rates; whereas high malaria rates were found in areas with high temperature, rainfall, and vegetation. INTERPRETATION: Malaria outbreaks could be forecasted using remotely measured environmental factors. Modelling techniques that enable simultaneously forecasting ahead in time as well as across large geographical areas might potentially empower regional decision makers to manage outbreaks early.

These patients underwent up to 15 years of neurological and ophthalmologic examinations and imaging. The selection of variables for the developing model was based on clinical importance and statistical significance, and any missing values were appropriately addressed. We developed a Decision Tree (DT) classifier as the primary model and manually tuned its hyperparameters for optimal performance. We employed SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for feature importance evaluation. All analysis was performed using Python version 3.10.9 and its associated libraries. Results A total of 388 patients completed the study, of which 154 developed clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS). It was observed that 61% of patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions developed CDMS. The final variables selected for analysis were MRI lesions, neurologic history, ON type, gender, and visual field mean deviation. The DT model achieved an accuracy of 70.1% during cross-validation and 69.1% on the test set, with an area under the curve of 74.9% and 71.7%, respectively. Comparative analysis of DT with other models showed similar performance. SHAP analysis revealed that MRI lesions and ON type emerged as the two most significant features, with relative importance of 61% and 18%, respectively.

In Rwanda, meeting the growing population’s demand for food has led to wetlands reclamation for cultivation and increased agrochemical enrichment for crop production. However, the ecological consequences of agrochemical enrichment on schistosomiasis transmission remain unexplored. Methods A malacological survey was conducted in 71 villages selected from 15 schistosomiasis endemic districts. Snail sampling was done in wetlands used for agriculture, along lake Kivu and at constructed multipurpose water dams. Water physico-chemical parameters were collected at all snail sampling sites. Analysis of collected data was performed using Xgboost (gain) and Random Forest (mean decrease in accuracy), machine learning techniques, to construct models that evaluate and categorize the importance of all physico-chemical properties on the presence and abundance of intermediate host snails (IHS). Results Different sets of parameters were relevant for the presence and abundance of Biomphalaria spp. and/or Bulinus spp. snails. Electrical conductivity, elevation, magnesium and lead content were deemed to shape the presence and abundance of Bulinus spp. snails. The impact of phosphate ion concentration, ammonia ions, total nitrogen and total organic carbon levels mirrored their importance towards the presence and abundance of Biomphalaria spp. Factors such as pH, electric conductivity, total nitrogen content and total organic carbon influenced the coexistence of both species. Our study highlights the value of integrating a wide range of predictor variables, enabling effective variable selection to uncover important predictors of snail distribution. Conclusion The results suggest that agrochemical compounds can enhance the abundance of IHS leading to an increased risk of Schistosoma transmission. Snail surveillance could therefore be integrated into agricultural expansion projects in our match towards schistosomiasis elimination. Recognizing the impact of agrochemicals on IHS is crucial for minimizing schistosomiasis transmission among those working in wetlands while meeting the growing need for food. © 2024 Kagabo et al.",,,Schistosomiasis transmission: A machine learning analysis reveals the importance of agrochemicals on snail abundance in Rwanda,YES

Unfortunately, existing methods are either inexpensive but poorly sensitive or sensitive but costly. Recent studies have shown that mid-infrared spectroscopy coupled with machine learning (MIRs-ML) has potential for rapidly detecting malaria infections but requires further evaluation on diverse samples representative of natural infections in endemic areas. The aim of this study was, therefore, to demonstrate a simple AI-powered, reagent-free, and user-friendly approach that uses mid-infrared spectra from dried blood spots to accurately detect malaria infections across varying parasite densities and anaemic conditions. Methods: Plasmodium falciparum strains NF54 and FCR3 were cultured and mixed with blood from 70 malaria-free individuals to create various malaria parasitaemia and anaemic conditions. Blood dilutions produced three haematocrit ratios (50%, 25%, 12.5%) and five parasitaemia levels (6%, 0.1%, 0.002%, 0.00003%, 0%). Dried blood spots were prepared on Whatman™ filter papers and scanned using attenuated total reflection-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) for machine-learning analysis. Three classifiers were trained on an 80%/20% split of 4655 spectra: (I) high contrast (6% parasitaemia vs. negative), (II) low contrast (0.00003% vs. negative) and (III) all concentrations (all positive levels vs. negative). The classifiers were validated with unseen datasets to detect malaria at various parasitaemia levels and anaemic conditions. Additionally, these classifiers were tested on samples from a population survey in malaria-endemic villages of southeastern Tanzania. Results: The AI classifiers attained over 90% accuracy in detecting malaria infections as low as one parasite per microlitre of blood, a sensitivity unattainable by conventional RDTs and microscopy. These laboratory-developed classifiers seamlessly transitioned to field applicability, achieving over 80% accuracy in predicting natural P. falciparum infections in blood samples collected during the field survey. Crucially, the performance remained unaffected by various levels of anaemia, a common complication in malaria patients. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the AI-driven mid-infrared spectroscopy approach holds promise as a simplified, sensitive and cost-effective method for malaria screening, consistently performing well despite variations in parasite densities and anaemic conditions. The technique simply involves scanning dried blood spots with a desktop mid-infrared scanner and analysing the spectra using pre-trained AI classifiers, making it readily adaptable to field conditions in low-resource settings. In this study, the approach was successfully adapted to field use, effectively predicting natural malaria infections in blood samples from a population-level survey in Tanzania. With additional field trials and validation, this technique could significantly enhance malaria surveillance and contribute to accelerating malaria elimination efforts. © The Author(s) 2024.",,"Rudolf Geigy Foundation; Swiss Tropical & Public Health Institute; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, HHMI; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF, (OPP 1217647, OPP1099295); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF; Royal Society, (ICA/R1/191238); Royal Society; Academy of Medical Sciences, (SBF007\100094); Academy of Medical Sciences",Screening of malaria infections in human blood samples with varying parasite densities and anaemic conditions using AI-Powered mid-infrared spectroscopy,YES

Methods: In this study, we developed and validated an AI-assisted diagnostic support tool using only routinely ordered and broadly available blood tests to predict the presence of major chronic and acute diseases as well as rare disorders. Results: Our model was tested on both retrospective and prospective datasets comprising over one million patients. We evaluated the diagnostic performance by (1) implementing ensemble learning (mean ROC-AUC.9293 and mean DOR 63.96); (2) assessing the model's sensitivity via risk scores to simulate its screening effectiveness; (3) analyzing the potential for early disease detection (30–270 days before clinical diagnosis) through creating historical patient timelines and (4) conducting validation on real-world clinical data in collaboration with Synlab Hungary, to assess the tool's performance in clinical setting. Discussion: Uniquely, our model not only considers stable blood values but also tracks changes from baseline across 15 years of patient history. Our AI-driven automated diagnostic tool can significantly enhance clinical practice by recognizing patterns in common and rare diseases, including malignancies. The models' ability to detect diseases 1–9 months earlier than traditional clinical diagnosis could contribute to reduced healthcare costs and improved patient outcomes. The automated evaluation also reduces evaluation time of healthcare providers, which accelerates diagnostic processes. By utilizing only routine blood tests and ensemble methods, the tool demonstrates high efficacy across independent laboratories and hospitals, making it an exceptionally valuable screening resource for primary care physicians. 2024 Németh, Tóth, Fülöp, Paragh, Nádró, Karányi, Paragh, Horváth, Csernák, Pintér, Sándor, Bagyó, Édes, Kappelmayer, Harangi and Daróczy.",blood test analysis; chronic diseases; classification; machine learning; prevention and control; rare diseases,"Mesterséges Intelligencia Nemzeti Laboratórium, MILAB; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, CNRS; European Commission, EC; National Research, Development and Innovation Office; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, GBMF; Nemzeti Kutatási Fejlesztési és Innovációs Hivatal, NKFIH, (K142273); Nemzeti Kutatási Fejlesztési és Innovációs Hivatal, NKFIH",Smart medical report: efficient detection of common and rare diseases on common blood tests,YES

Currently, the field lacks a universally acknowledged gold standard and early detection methods for VC. Methods: Using data from the GEO database, we identified VC's impact on HF through key genes using Limma and STRING databases. The potential mechanisms of HF exacerbation were explored via GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. Diagnostic genes for acute decompensated HF were discovered using LASSO, RF, and SVM-REF machine learning algorithms, complemented by single-gene GSEA analysis. A nomogram tool was developed for the diagnostic model's evaluation and application, with validation conducted on external datasets. Results: Our findings reveal that VC influences 37 genes impacting HF via 8 genes, primarily affecting oxygen transport, binding, and extracellular matrix stability. Four diagnostic genes for HF's pre-decompensation phase were identified: SMOC2, OGN, FCN3, and SERPINA3. These genes showed high diagnostic potential, with AUCs for each gene exceeding 0.9 and a genomic AUC of 0.942. Conclusions: Our study identifies four critical diagnostic genes for HF's pre-decompensated phase using bioinformatics and machine learning, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms through which VC worsens HF. It offers a novel approach for clinical evaluation of acute decompensated HF patient congestion status, presenting fresh insights into its pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment. 2024 Yu, Yuan, Han, Shi, Liu, Xue and Li.",bioinformatics; heart failure; machine learning; nomogram; venous congestion,"Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2023MH053); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province","SMOC2, OGN, FCN3, and SERPINA3 could be biomarkers for the evaluation of acute decompensated heart failure caused by venous congestion",YES

We analyzed the spatial patterns of these infections in the city of Tartagal, Salta province, by an observational, correlational, and cross-sectional study in children and adolescents aged 1 to 15 years from native communities. One fecal sample per individual was collected to detect IPs using various diagnostic techniques: Telemann sedimentation, Baermann culture, and Kato-Katz. Moran’s global and local indices were applied together with SaTScan to assess the spatial distribution, with a focus on cluster detection. The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine-learning model was used to predict the presence of IPs and their transmission pathways. Based on the analysis of 572 fecal samples, a prevalence of 78.3% was found. The most frequent parasite was Giardia lamblia (30.9%). High-and low-risk clusters were observed for most species, distributed in an east-west direction and polarized in two large foci, one near the city of Tartagal and the other in the km 6 community. Spatial XGBoost models were obtained based on distances with a minimum median accuracy of 0.69. Different spatial patterns reflecting the mechanisms of transmission were noted. The distribution of the majority of the parasites studied was aligned in a westerly direction close to the city, but the STH presence was higher in the km 6 community, toward the east. The purely spatial analysis provides a different and complementary overview for the detection of vulnerable hotspots and strategic intervention.

These constraints, caused by rigid and traditional statistical tools which collapse amidst ‘Big Data’, prompt interpretable machine-learning (iML) approaches. Predicting dengue incidence and mortality in the Philippines, a data-limited yet high-burden country, the mlr3 universe of R packages was used to build and optimize ML models based on remotely sensed provincial and dekadal 3 NDVI and 9 rainfall features from 2016 to 2020. Between two tasks, models differ across four random forest-based learners and two clustering strategies. Among 16 candidates, rfsrc-year-case and ranger-year-death significantly perform best for predicting dengue incidence and mortality, respectively. Therefore, temporal clustering yields the best models, reflective of dengue seasonality. The two best models were subjected to tripartite global exploratory model analyses, which encompass model-agnostic post-hoc methods such as Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE). PFI reveals that the models differ in their important explanatory aspect, rainfall for rfsrc-year-case and NDVI for ranger-year-death, among which long-term average (lta) features are most relevant. Trend-wise, ALE reveals that average incidence predictions are positively associated with ‘Rain.lta’, reflective of dengue cases peaking during the wet season. In contrast, those for mortality are negatively associated with ‘NDVI.lta’, reflective of urban spaces driving dengue-related deaths.

SDMs can create high-resolution maps of host distribution across geographical scales, reflecting baseline risk of disease. However, as SDM computational methods have rapidly expanded, there are many outstanding methodological questions. Here we address key questions about SDM application, using schistosomiasis risk in Brazil as a case study. Schistosomiasis is transmitted to humans through contact with the free-living infectious stage of Schistosoma spp. parasites released from freshwater snails, the parasite’s obligate intermediate hosts. In this study, we compared snail SDM performance across machine learning (ML) approaches (MaxEnt, Random Forest, and Boosted Regression Trees), geographic extents (national, regional, and state), types of presence data (expert-collected and publicly-available), and snail species (Biomphalaria glabrata, B. straminea, and B. tenagophila). We used high-resolution (1km) climate, hydrology, land-use/land-cover (LULC), and soil property data to describe the snails’ ecological niche and evaluated models on multiple criteria. Although all ML approaches produced comparable spatially cross-validated performance metrics, their suitability maps showed major qualitative differences that required validation based on local expert knowledge. Additionally, our findings revealed varying importance of LULC and bioclimatic variables for different snail species at different spatial scales. Finally, we found that models using publicly-available data predicted snail distribution with comparable AUC values to models using expert-collected data. This work serves as an instructional guide to SDM methods that can be applied to a range of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases. In addition, it advances our understanding of the relevant environment and bioclimatic determinants of schistosomiasis risk in Brazil. © 2024 Singleton et al.

In this study, we propose a comprehensive approach to extract mortality causes and identify prevalent diseases from VA narratives utilizing advanced text mining techniques, so as to better understand the underlying health issues leading to mortality. Our methodology integrates ngram- based language processing, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and BERTopic, offering a multi-faceted analysis to enhance the accuracy and depth of information extraction. This is a retrospective study that uses secondary data analysis. We used data from the Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance Site (HDSS), which had 16338 observations collected between 1993 and 2015. Our text mining steps entailed data acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, topic segmentation, and discovered knowledge. The results suggest that the HDSS population may have died from mortality causes such as vomiting, chest/stomach pain, fever, coughing, loss of weight, low energy, headache. Additionally, we discovered that the most prevalent diseases entailed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB), diarrhoea, cancer, neurological disorders, malaria, diabetes, high blood pressure, chronic ailments (kidney, heart, lung, liver), maternal and accident related deaths. This study is relevant in that it avails valuable insights regarding mortality causes and most prevalent diseases using novel text mining approaches. These results can be integrated in the diagnosis pipeline for ease of human annotation and interpretation.

We performed a prospective study embedded in a cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) to evaluate the attrition, fabric integrity and insecticidal durability of Interceptor® G2 (alpha-cypermethrin-chlorfenapyr) and Royal Guard® (alpha-cypermethrin–pyriproxyfen), compared to Interceptor® (alpha-cypermethrin) in Benin. Methods: A total of 2428 study nets in 1093 randomly selected households in five clusters per arm of the cRCT were monitored for ITN attrition and fabric integrity every 6–12 months post-distribution. Householders were further surveyed to investigate non-study net use and their preference for ITN fabric types used in the study nets. A second cohort of 120 nets per ITN type were withdrawn every 12 months and assessed for chemical content and insecticidal activity in laboratory bioassays. Alpha-cypermethrin bioefficacy was investigated using the susceptible Anopheles gambiae Kisumu strain, and chlorfenapyr and pyriproxyfen bioefficacy were investigated using the pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles coluzzii Akron strain. Net pieces were tested in WHO cone bioassays and tunnel tests for alpha-cypermethrin and in tunnel tests for chlorfenapyr; pyriproxyfen activity was assessed in cone bioassays as the reduction in fertility of blood-fed survivors using ovary dissection. Bioefficacy was expressed as the proportion of ITNs passing predetermined WHO criteria, namely knock-down ≥ 95% or 24/72 h mortality ≥ 80% or reduction in fertility ≥ 50%. Results: Overall ITN survivorship was 52% at 24 months and fell to 15% at 36 months. Median ITN survival time was lower with Royal Guard® relative to Interceptor® [1.6 vs 2.3 years; hazard ratio (HR) 1.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36–1.66; p < 0.001] and Interceptor® G2 (1.6 vs 2.1 years; HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.20–1.47; p < 0.001). Householders overwhelmingly preferred polyester nets over polyethylene nets (96%), and more Royal Guard® nets were replaced with spare polyester nets from previous campaigns. All Royal Guard® nets passed efficacy criteria for alpha-cypermethrin at all time points (100%) while ITN pass rates after 24 months had fallen to < 40% for pyriproxyfen and chlorfenapyr. The chemical content analysis showed a higher loss rate of the non-pyrethroid insecticides relative to the pyrethroids in each dual ingredient AI ITN; 74% vs 47% for Royal Guard® and 85% vs 63% for Interceptor® G2 at 36 months. Conclusions: The median ITN survival time for Interceptor® G2 (2.1 years) and Royal Guard® (1.6 years) in Benin is substantially lower than 3 years. Royal Guard® nets were discarded more quickly by householders, partly due to their low preference for polyethylene nets. The insecticidal activity of the non-pyrethroid insecticides in both dual AI ITNs was short-lived compared to alpha-cypermethrin.

One method to estimate these effects is the synthetic control method, which constructs a synthetic control, a weighted average of control units that best matches the treated unit’s pre-treatment outcomes and other relevant covariates. The intervention’s impact is then estimated by comparing the post-intervention outcomes of the treated unit and its synthetic control, which serves as a proxy for the counterfactual outcome had the treated unit not experienced the intervention. The augmented synthetic control method, a recent adaptation of the synthetic control method, relaxes some of the synthetic control method’s assumptions for broader applicability. While synthetic controls have been used in a variety of fields, their use in public health and biomedical research is more recent, and newer methods such as the augmented synthetic control method are underutilized. This paper briefly describes the synthetic control method and its application, explains the augmented synthetic control method and its differences from the synthetic control method, and estimates the effects of an antimalarial initiative in Mozambique using both the synthetic control method and the augmented synthetic control method to highlight the advantages of using the augmented synthetic control method to analyze the impact of interventions implemented in a single region. © The Author(s) 2024.",Causal inference; comparative case studies; counterfactual; synthetic control; treatment effect,"National Malaria Control Program; Ministry of Health, MOH; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01 AI085073); National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, (T32 ES007018)",The augmented synthetic control method in public health and biomedical research,NO

This strains public health systems and raises the risk of lifelong impairments and disabilities. Worryingly, the three countries most affected by HD witnessed a growth in new cases in 2022, jeopardizing the World Health Organization’s targets to interrupt transmission. Artificial intelligence (AI) can help address these challenges by offering the potential for rapid case detection, customized treatment, and solutions for accessibility challenges—especially in regions with a shortage of trained healthcare professionals. This perspective article explores how AI can significantly impact the clinical management of HD, focusing on therapeutic strategies. AI can help classify cases, ensure multidrug therapy compliance, monitor geographical treatment coverage, and detect adverse drug reactions and antimicrobial resistance. In addition, AI can assist in the early detection of nerve damage, which aids in disability prevention and planning rehabilitation. Incorporating AI into mental health counseling is also a promising contribution to combating the stigma associated with HD.

However, traditional public surveys are time-consuming and labor-intensive and do not allow for timely decision-making. Recent studies have explored text analytic approaches to elicit public comments from social media for public health. Therefore, this study aims to demonstrate a text analytics pipeline to identify the MBD topics that were discussed on Twitter and significantly influenced public opinion. A total of 25,000 tweets were retrieved from Twitter, topics were modelled using LDA and sentiment polarities were calculated using the VADER model. After data cleaning, we obtained a total of 6,243 tweets, which we were able to process with the feature selection algorithms. Boruta was used as a feature selection algorithm to determine the importance of topics to public opinion. The result was validated using multinomial logistic regression (MLR) performance and expert judgement. Important issues such as breeding sites, mosquito control, impact/funding, time of year, other diseases with similar symptoms, mosquito-human interaction and biomarkers for diagnosis were identified by both LDA and experts.

Therefore, there is a need to use recent technological advances to improve vector surveillance methodologies. Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), often called drones, have been used to collect high-resolution imagery to map detailed information on mosquito habitats and direct control measures to specific areas. Supervised classification approaches have been largely used to automatically detect vector habitats. However, manual data labelling for model training limits their use for rapid responses. Open-source foundation models such as the Meta AI Segment Anything Model (SAM) can facilitate the manual digitalization of high-resolution images. This pre-trained model can assist in extracting features of interest in a diverse range of images. Here, we evaluated the performance of SAM through the Samgeo package, a Python-based wrapper for geospatial data, as it has not been applied to analyse remote sensing images for epidemiological studies. Results: We tested the identification of two land cover classes of interest: water bodies and human settlements, using different UAV acquired imagery across five malaria-endemic areas in Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. We employed manually placed point prompts and text prompts associated with specific classes of interest to guide the image segmentation and assessed the performance in the different geographic contexts. An average Dice coefficient value of 0.67 was obtained for buildings segmentation and 0.73 for water bodies using point prompts. Regarding the use of text prompts, the highest Dice coefficient value reached 0.72 for buildings and 0.70 for water bodies. Nevertheless, the performance was closely dependent on each object, landscape characteristics and selected words, resulting in varying performance. Conclusions: Recent models such as SAM can potentially assist manual digitalization of imagery by vector control programs, quickly identifying key features when surveying an area of interest. However, accurate segmentation still requires user-provided manual prompts and corrections to obtain precise segmentation.

The immune response involves the activation of various cells to eliminate the infection. Understanding the complex interplay between Leishmania and the host immune system is crucial for developing effective treatments against this disease. Methods This study collected extensive transcriptomic data from macrophages, dendritic, and NK cells exposed to Leishmania spp. Our objective was to determine the Leishmania-responsive genes in immune system cells by applying meta-analysis and feature selection algorithms, followed by co-expression analysis. Results As a result of meta-analysis, we discovered 703 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), primarily associated with the immune system and cellular metabolic processes. In addition, we have substantiated the significance of transcription factor families, such as bZIP and C2H2 ZF, in response to Leishmania infection. Furthermore, the feature selection techniques revealed the potential of two genes, namely G0S2 and CXCL8, as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for Leishmania infection. Lastly, our co-expression analysis has unveiled seven hub genes, including PFKFB3, DIAPH1, BSG, BIRC3, GOT2, EIF3H, and ATF3, chiefly related to signaling pathways.

Malaria incidence was also consistently lower in too-torn PBO-PY LLIN (IRR = 0.37 [95% CI 0.19–0.72], p = 0.003) and chlorfenapyr-PY LLIN (IRR = 0.45 [95% CI 0.33–0.97], p = 0.053) compared to an intact PY-only LLIN during the first year of follow up. In year 2, the incidence was only significantly lower in intact chlorfenapyr-PY LLIN (IRR = 0.49 [95% CI 0.29–0.81], p = 0.006) compared to intact PY LLIN. Conclusion: The study confirmed that sleeping under a chlorfenapyr-PY LLIN or PBO-PY LLIN offered superior protection to pyrethroid-only nets even when torn.

Early and accurate prediction of their outbreaks is crucial for disease control. The aim of this study was to develop zoonotic diseases risk predictive models based on time-series incidence data and three zoonotic diseases in mainland China were employed as cases. Methods: The incidence data for schistosomiasis, echinococcosis, and leptospirosis were downloaded from the Scientific Data Centre of the National Ministry of Health of China, and were processed by interpolation, dynamic curve reconstruction and time series decomposition. Data were decomposed into three distinct components: the trend component, the seasonal component, and the residual component. The trend component was used as input to construct the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) prediction model, while the seasonal component was used in the comparison of the periods and amplitudes. Finaly, the accuracy of the hybrid LSTM prediction model was comprehensive evaluated. Results: This study employed trend series of incidence numbers and incidence rates of three zoonotic diseases for modeling. The prediction results of the model showed that the predicted incidence number and incidence rate were very close to the real incidence data. Model evaluation revealed that the prediction error of the hybrid LSTM model was smaller than that of the single LSTM. Thus, these results demonstrate that using trending sequences as input sequences for the model leads to better-fitting predictive models. Conclusions: Our study successfully developed LSTM hybrid models for disease outbreak risk prediction using three zoonotic diseases as case studies. We demonstrate that the LSTM, when combined with time series decomposition, delivers more accurate results compared to conventional LSTM models using the raw data series.

Deep learning-based methods have shown success in computer-aided diagnosis from microscopic images. However, these methods need annotated images that show cells affected by malaria parasites and their life stages. Annotating images from LCM significantly increases the burden on medical experts compared to annotating images from high-cost microscopes (HCM). For this reason, a practical solution would be trained on HCM images which should generalize well on LCM images during testing. While earlier methods adopted a multi-stage learning process, they did not offer an end-to-end approach. In this work, we present an end-to-end learning framework, named CodaMal (COntrastive Domain Adpation for MALaria).

Hierarchical Bayesian models have emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for disease mapping since they are able to both capture structure in the data and robustly characterise uncertainty. When working with areal data, e.g. aggregates at the administrative unit level such as district or province, current models rely on the adjacency structure of areal units to account for spatial correlations and perform shrinkage. The goal of disease surveillance systems is to track disease outcomes over time. This task is especially challenging in crisis situations which often lead to redrawn administrative boundaries, meaning that data collected before and after the crisis are no longer directly comparable. Moreover, the adjacency-based approach ignores the continuous nature of spatial processes and cannot solve the change-of-support problem, i.e. when estimates are required to be produced at different administrative levels or levels of aggregation.

The diagnostic process must be automated to avoid human participation during the automated diagnosis because a delayed or inaccurate diagnosis causes most of these deaths. To enhance diagnostic reliability, deep-learning technologies and CNN, such as medical image processing techniques, are employed to assess parasitemia in microscopic blood slides. In this research, we propose a supervised learning-based Visual Geometry Group (VGG-19) that performs accurate classification to detect malaria-infected cells. The dataset comprises 27,560 images of segmented blood cells, equally divided into parasitized (infected) and uninfected cells, which were utilized for VGG-19 architecture. The first step is to define the image processing methods that can be used to analyze the dataset for training the model. The next stage discusses the techniques for training deep neural networks and the data augmentation techniques used to increase the size of the dataset and enhance the model's performance. Finally, the accuracy of classification outcomes is compared from deep CNN using the same datasets for the testing, training and validating phases. Our trained model uses blood smear samples to predict the presence of malarial-infected cells and achieves a 97% accuracy rate. © 2024 IEEE.",Accuracy; CNNs; Data Augmentation; Overfitting,"National Defence University of Malaysia, NDUM, (A0014); National Defence University of Malaysia, NDUM",Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network Malarial Cells Detection,YES

Using the Bottleneck distance approach, we achieve 95.95% accuracy in crack detection and 93.11% in malaria diagnosis with only one labeled sample per class. These results outperform the best performance from machine learning models, which achieves 69.40% and 39.75% accuracy, respectively, and deep learning models, which attains up to 95.96% in crack detection and 62.72% in malaria diagnosis. This demonstrates the superior performance of topological methods in classification tasks with few labeled data. Hybrid approaches demonstrate enhanced performance as the number of labeled samples increases, effectively leveraging topological features to boost classification accuracy. This study highlights the robustness of topological methods in extracting meaningful features from limited data, offering promising directions for efficient, label-conserving classification strategies.

Despite progress in predictive modeling, the rising incidence and complexity of dengue necessitate more precise forecasting techniques. This study leverages a comprehensive dataset from Bangladesh, spanning 2019 to 2023, to improve dengue outbreak predictions by using hybrid models that blend traditional statistical methods with advanced machine learning algorithms. The research employs a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model, along with XGBoost and Random Forest Regression, to predict dengue incidence based on temporal and climatic variables. The dataset consists of 900 daily records, capturing crucial details such as date, month, year, and dengue cases to reflect seasonal trends impacting disease transmission. The results indicate that the XGBoost model, enhanced with features like DayOfWeek and Month, markedly surpasses other models. It achieved the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 2.6108 and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 1.6158, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy. Conversely, the SARIMA model, despite its ability to capture temporal patterns, showed limitations in managing non-linear trends, resulting in a higher RMSE.These findings emphasize the effectiveness of combining machine learning techniques with time series analysis to forecast dengue trends, offering a vital tool for public health officials to apply timely interventions.

Early warning of malaria outbreaks is crucial for effective control and mitigation of the devastating impacts of malaria. Tapping into the vital role indigenous knowledge (IK) plays in combating infectious diseases and the success of an artificial intelligence technique called fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) in modelling infectious diseases, this paper aims to predict malaria outbreaks using IK and FCM. The concepts used to develop the FCM were the IK indicators participants in Vhembe in South Africa used to ṇpredict malaria outbreaks. These IK indicators were collected through unstructured interviews. The developed malaria outbreak prediction FCM model was used to conduct simulations and make predictions of malaria outbreaks. As an initial stride for constructing such a tool, this paper demonstrates how the artificial intelligence technique, FCM, can represent IK indicators and predict malaria outbreaks. This promotes the recognition of IK in the effort to control and mitigate malaria outbreaks.

While effective vector control is crucial in the absence of reliable dengue vaccines, traditional control methods face obstacles like mosquito resistance to insecticides and a very high cost. By combining geospatial data, including satellite imagery, as descriptors, and entomological surveys as target variables in a Random Forest model, we predicted the number of potential mosquito breeding sites, derived the associated environmental carrying capacity for larvae, and used the Arbocarto process-based model to predict Ae.aegypti population densities in an urban region of French Guiana, South America.

Propensity score matched PAH and non-PAH (control) cohorts were established based on observed differences. Random forest models were used to classify patients as PAH or non-PAH at diagnosis and at 6 months prediagnosis. The PAH and non-PAH cohorts included 1339 and 4222 patients, respectively. At 6 months prediagnosis, the model performed well in distinguishing PAH and non-PAH patients, with area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic of 0.84, recall (sensitivity) of 0.73, and precision of 0.50. Key features distinguishing PAH from non-PAH cohorts were a longer time between first symptom and the prediagnosis model date (i.e., 6 months before diagnosis); more diagnostic and prescription claims, circulatory claims, and imaging procedures, leading to higher overall healthcare resource utilization; and more hospitalizations.

We collected the paraffin samples of CRC patients with or without S. japonicum infection according to standard procedures. Data-Independent Acquisition was used to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), protein–protein interaction (PPI) network construction, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analysis and machine learning algorithms (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression) were used to identify candidate genes for diagnosing CRC with S. japonicum infection. To assess the diagnostic value, the nomogram and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were developed. A total of 115 DEPs were screened, the DEPs that were discovered were mostly related with biological process in generation of precursor metabolites and energy,energy derivation by oxidation of organic compounds, carboxylic acid metabolic process, oxoacid metabolic process, cellular respiration aerobic respiration according to the analyses. Enrichment analysis showed that these compounds might regulate oxidoreductase activity, transporter activity, transmembrane transporter activity, ion transmembrane transporter activity and inorganic molecular entity transmembrane transporter activity. Following the development of PPI network and LASSO, 13 genes (hsd17b4, h2ac4, hla-c, pc, epx, rpia, tor1aip1, mindy1, dpysl5, nucks1, cnot2, ndufa13 and dnm3) were filtered, and 3 candidate hub genes were chosen for nomogram building and diagnostic value evaluation after machine learning. The nomogram and all 3 candidate hub genes (hsd17b4, rpia and cnot2) had high diagnostic values (area under the curve is 0.9556). The results of our study indicate that the combination of hsd17b4, rpia, and cnot2 may become a predictive model for the occurrence of CRC in combination with S. japonicum infection.

This disease is transmitted to humans through the bites of Anopheles mosquitoes that carry the infection. This disease has significant and devastating consequences on the health systems of fragile countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Malaria affects red blood cells by invading and replicating within them, destroying them, and releasing toxic byproducts into the bloodstream. The parasite's ability to stick and modify the surface of red blood cells can cause them to become sticky, obstructing blood flow in vital organs such as the brain and spleen. Therefore, efficient approaches for the early detection of malaria are critical to saving patients’ lives. The main aim of this study is to develop an efficient model for early malaria diagnosis. We used malaria images based on parasitized and uninfected red blood cells for the study experiments. We applied neural network-based approaches such as Neural Search Architecture Network (NASNet) and compared its performance with machine learning techniques. Moreover, we proposed a novel NNR (NASNet Random forest) method for feature engineering. The proposed NNR approach first extracts spatial features from input malaria images, then class prediction probability features are extracted from these spatial features. The feature set obtained from the data extraction trains machine learning models. Our comprehensive experiments show that the support vector machine outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving a high-performance score of 99% and having an inference time near 0.025 s. We validated the performance using k-fold cross-validation and optimized the hyperparameters through tuning. Our proposed research has improved the early diagnosis of malaria and can assist medical specialists in reducing the mortality rate. © 2023 The Author(s)",Deep learning; Machine learning; Malaria diagnosis; Neural search architecture network; Red blood cells; Transfer learning,,A novel transfer learning-based model for diagnosing malaria from parasitized and uninfected red blood cell images,YES

Treatment with radical cure drugs fails to target the hidden asymptomatic and hypnozoite reservoirs in populations. PvSeroTAT, a novel serological test-and-treat intervention using a serological diagnostic to screen hypnozoite carriers for radical cure eligibility and treatment, could accelerate P. vivax elimination. Methods: Using a previously developed mathematical model of P. vivax transmission adapted to the Brazilian context as a case study for implementation, we evaluate the public health impact of various deployment strategies of PvSeroTAT as a mass campaign. We compare relative reductions in prevalence, cases averted, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) tests, and treatment doses of PvSeroTAT campaigns to strengthened case management alone or mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns across different settings. Findings: Deploying a single round of PvSeroTAT with 80% coverage to treat cases with a high efficacy radical cure regimen with primaquine is predicted to reduce point population prevalence by 22.5% [95% UI: 20.2%–24.8%] in a peri-urban setting with high transmission and by 25.2% [95% UI: 9.6%–42.2%] in an occupational setting with moderate transmission. In the latter example, while a single PvSeroTAT achieves 9.2% less impact on prevalence and averts 300 less cases per 100,000 than a single MDA (25.2% [95% UI: 9.6%–42.2%] point prevalence reduction versus 34.4% [95% UI: 24.9%–44%]), PvSeroTAT requires 4.6 times less radical cure treatments and G6PD tests. Layering strengthened case management and deploying four rounds of PvSeroTAT six months apart is predicted to reduce point prevalence by a mean of 74.1% [95% UI: 61.3%–86.3%] or more in low transmission settings with less than 10 cases per 1000 population. Interpretation: Modelling predicts that mass campaigns with PvSeroTAT are predicted to reduce P. vivax parasite prevalence across a range of transmission settings and require fewer resources than MDA. In combination with strengthened case management, mass campaigns of serological test-and-treat interventions can accelerate towards P. vivax elimination.

Therefore, we sought to identify adipokine levels in patients with varying severities of acute dengue to understand their role in disease pathogenesis. We determined the levels of leptin, resistin, omentin, adiponectin, as well as IFNβ, and NS1 using quantitative ELISA in patients with dengue fever (DF = 49) and dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF = 22) at admission (febrile phase) and at the time of discharge (recovery phase). The viral loads and serotypes of all samples were quantified using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Resistin levels (p = 0.04) and omentin (p = 0.006) levels were significantly higher in patients who developed DHF. Omentin levels in the febrile phase also correlated with the AST (Spearman’s r = 0.38, p = 0.001) and ALT levels (Spearman’s r = 0.24, p = 0.04); as well as serum leptin levels with both AST (Spearman’s r = 0.27, p = 0.02) and ALT (Spear-man’s r = 0.28, p = 0.02). Serum adiponectin levels in the febrile phase did not correlate with any of the other adipokines or with liver enzymes, but inversely correlated with CRP levels (Spearman’s r =-0.31, p = 0.008). Although not significant (p = 0.14) serum IFNβ levels were lower in the febrile phase in those who progressed to develop DHF (median 0, IQR 0 to 39.4 pg/ml), compared to those who had DF (median 37.1, IQR 0 to 65.6 pg.ml). The data suggest that adipokines are likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of dengue, which should be further explored for the potential to be used as prognostic markers and as therapeutic targets. © 2023 Kuruppu et al.",,"National Institutes of Health, NIH, (5U01AI151788-02); Medical Research Council, MRC",Adipokine levels and their association with clinical disease severity in patients with dengue,NO

Early identification and accurate diagnosis play a crucial role in effective malaria treatment. However, underdiagnosis presents a significant challenge in reducing mortality rates, and traditional laboratory diagnosis methods have limitations in terms of time consumption and error susceptibility. To overcome these challenges, researchers have increasingly utilized Machine Learning techniques, specifically neural networks, which provide faster, cost-effective, and highly accurate diagnostic capabilities. Methods: This study aimed to compare the performance of a traditional neural network (NN) with a convolutional neural network (CNN) in the diagnosis and classification of different types of malaria using blood smear images. We curated a comprehensive malaria dataset comprising 1,920 images obtained from 84 patients suspected of having various malaria strains. The dataset consisted of 624 images of Falciparum, 548 images of Vivax, 588 images of Ovale, and 160 images from suspected healthy individuals, obtained from local hospitals in Iran. To ensure precise analysis, we developed a unique segmentation model that effectively eliminated therapeutically beneficial cells from the image context, enabling accurate analysis using artificial intelligence algorithms. Results: The evaluation of the traditional NN and the proposed 6-layer CNN model for image classification yielded average accuracies of 95.11% and 99.59%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the CNN, as a primary algorithm of deep neural networks (DNN), outperforms the traditional NN in analyzing different classes of malaria images. The CNN model demonstrated superior diagnostic performance, delivering enhanced accuracy and reliability in the classifying of malaria cases. Conclusion: This research underscores the potential of ML technologies, specifically CNNs, in improving malaria diagnosis and classification. By leveraging advanced image analysis techniques, including the developed segmentation model, CNN showcased remarkable proficiency in accurately identifying and classifying various malaria parasites from blood smear images. The adoption of machine learning-based approaches holds promise for more effective management and treatment of malaria, addressing the challenges of underdiagnosis and improving patient outcomes. © 2023, Iranian Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Society.

Early diagnosis of malaria will effectively decrease the death rate. In this article, we develop an automatic malaria disease diagnosis framework integrating blockchain-enabled cloud-edge computing and deep learning. The diagnosis task is divided into malaria parasite segmentation from blood smear images and classification of parasite species and stages. To meet the massive demand for deep learning training, we design a diagnosis pipeline that is deployed in a cloud-edge paradigm to utilize both local and remote resources. At edge nodes, preprocessed data sets are classified by U-Net in a supervised approach to generate coarse probability maps. Then, the normalized images and generated probability maps are uploaded to the cloud server. At the cloud, the uploaded probability maps are used to weakly supervise the stacked dilated U-Net (SDU-Net) to segment infected cells. Further classifications of malaria parasites species and stages are conducted by a pretrained MobileNet V1. The blockchain technology is adopted during the data transmission process. The diagnosis results will be sent back to the original local hospital immediately through the cloud. Our framework improves the diagnosis accuracy and eases the burden of deep learning training.

Serology can provide robust estimates of malaria transmission intensities, and multiplex serological assays allow for simultaneous assessment of markers of recent and historical malaria exposure. Methods: Here, we evaluated different statistical and machine learning methods for analyzing multiplex malaria-specific antibody response data to classify recent and historical exposure to Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. To assess these methods, we utilized samples from a health-facility based survey (n = 9132) in the Philippines, where we quantified antibody responses against 8 P. falciparum and 6 P. vivax-specific antigens from 3 sites with varying transmission intensity. Findings: Measurements of antibody responses and seroprevalence were consistent with the 3 sites’ known endemicity status. Among the models tested, a machine learning (ML) approach (Random Forest model) using 4 serological markers (PfGLURP R2, Etramp5.Ag1, GEXP18, and PfMSP119) gave better predictions for P. falciparum recent infection in Palawan (AUC: 0.9591, CI 0.9497–0.9684) than individual antigen seropositivity. Although the ML approach did not improve P. vivax infection predictions, ML classifications confirmed the absence of recent exposure to P. falciparum and P. vivax in both Occidental Mindoro and Bataan. For predicting historical P. falciparum and P. vivax transmission, seroprevalence and seroconversion rates based on cumulative exposure markers AMA1 and MSP119 showed reliable trends in the 3 sites. Interpretation: Our study emphasizes the utility of serological markers in predicting recent and historical exposure in a sub-national elimination setting, and also highlights the potential use of machine learning models using multiplex antibody responses to improve assessment of the malaria transmission status of countries aiming for elimination.

Control measure for the mosquito population plays an essential role in the fight against the disease. Currently, several intervention strategies; chemical-, biological-, mechanical- and environmental methods remain under development and need further improvement in their effectiveness. Although, a conventional entomological surveillance, required a microscope and taxonomic key for identification by professionals, is a key strategy to evaluate the population growth of these mosquitoes, these techniques are tedious, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and reliant on skillful and well-trained personnel. Here, we proposed an automatic screening, namely the deep metric learning approach and its inference under the image-retrieval process with Euclidean distance-based similarity. We aimed to develop the optimized model to find suitable miners and suggested the robustness of the proposed model by evaluating it with unseen data under a 20-returned image system. During the model development, well-trained ResNet34 are outstanding and no performance difference when comparing five data miners that showed up to 98% in its precision even after testing the model with both image sources: stereomicroscope and mobile phone cameras.

In this study, training was conducted on 27,558 malaria cell image data through Inception-V3 architecture by proposing 3 scenarios. The proposed scenario 1 model applies the SGD optimizer to generate a loss value of 0.13 and an accuracy value of 0.95; scenario 2 model applies the Adam optimizer to generate a loss value of 0.09 and an accuracy value of 0.96; and lastly scenario 3 implements the RMSprop optimizer to generate a loss value of 0.08 and an accuracy value of 0.97. Applying the three scenarios, the results of the study apparently indicate that the Inception-V3 model using the RMSprop optimizer is capable of providing the best accuracy results with an accuracy of 97% with the lowest loss value, compared to scenario 1 and scenario 2. Further, the test results confirms that the proposed model in this study is capable of classifying malaria cells effectively. © 2023, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

2023.0,outbreak prediction,"National University of Asunción, Polythecnic School, San Lorenzo, Paraguay; National University of Asunción, Engineering School, San Lorenzo, Paraguay","Public health problems such as dengue fever need accurate forecasts so governments can take effective preventive measures. Machine learning, in particular deep learning (DL) have become increasingly popular as the volume of data increases continuously. Nevertheless, performing accurate predictions in areas with fewer cases can be challenging. When we apply DL models using long short-term memory (LSTM) in different cities considering weekly dengue incidence and climate, some models may present heterogeneous behaviors and poor accuracy because of the need for more data. To mitigate this problem, clustering analysis across time series is performed based on scores to measure the clustering quality in 217 Paraguayan cities. First, we compare the raw and feature-based clustering techniques considering several metrics. Our results indicate that hierarchical clustering combined with Spearman correlation is the most appropriate approach. Finally, several LSTM models built using clustering results were compared. The root-mean-square error confirms that the clustered models improve accuracy by 19.48 ± 18.80%. Finally, we present a comparison between one-dimensional statistical clustering and our best clustering setup. The main contribution of this work is a technique that can improve the performance of time series models that combine information from similar time series and weather data. © 2023 Latin American Center for Informatics Studies.

LSM has contributed in many successful attempts to eliminate the disease across the Globe. However, this approach is typically labour-intensive, largely due to the difficulties in locating and mapping potential malarial mosquito breeding sites. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential for drone imaging technology to map malaria vector breeding sites. However, key questions remain unanswered related to the use and cost of this technology within operational vector control. Methods: Using Zanzibar (United Republic of Tanzania) as a demonstration site, a protocol was collaboratively designed that employs drones and smartphones for supporting operational LSM, termed the Spatial Intelligence System (SIS). SIS was evaluated over a four-month LSM programme by comparing key mapping accuracy indicators and relative costs (both mapping costs and intervention costs) against conventional ground-based methods. Additionally, malaria case incidence was compared between the SIS and conventional study areas, including an estimation of the incremental cost-effectiveness of switching from conventional to SIS larviciding. Results: The results demonstrate that the SIS approach is significantly more accurate than a conventional approach for mapping potential breeding sites: mean % correct per site: SIS = 60% (95% CI 32–88%, p = 0.02), conventional = 18% (95% CI − 3–39%). Whilst SIS cost more in the start-up phase, overall annualized costs were similar to the conventional approach, with a simulated cost per person protected per year of $3.69 ($0.32 to $15.12) for conventional and $3.94 ($0.342 to $16.27) for SIS larviciding. The main economic benefits were reduced labour costs associated with SIS in the pre-intervention baseline mapping of habitats. There was no difference in malaria case incidence between the three arms. Cost effectiveness analysis showed that SIS is likely to provide similar health benefits at similar costs compared to the conventional arm. Conclusions: The use of drones and smartphones provides an improved means of mapping breeding sites for use in operational LSM. Furthermore, deploying this technology does not appear to be more costly than a conventional ground-based approach and, as such, may represent an important tool for Malaria Control Programmes that plan to implement LSM. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",,"Innovative Vector Control Consortium; Sazani Associates; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF",Cost and quality of operational larviciding using drones and smartphone technology,NO

In May 2022, a multicountry outbreak of Mpox in non-endemic countries was confirmed by the World Health Organization. This study aimed to identify signals of fever and rash-like illness using EPIWATCH and, if detected, determine if they represented potential Mpox outbreaks. Study design: The EPIWATCH AI system was used to detect global signals for syndromes of rash and fever that may have represented a missed diagnosis of Mpox from 1 month prior to the initial case confirmation in the United Kingdom (7 May 2022) to 2 months following. Methods: Articles were extracted from EPIWATCH and underwent review. A descriptive epidemiologic analysis was conducted to identify reports pertaining to each rash-like illness, locations of each outbreak and report publication dates for the entries from 2022, with 2021 as a control surveillance period. Results: Reports of rash-like illnesses in 2022 between 1 April and 11 July (n = 656 reports) were higher than in the same period in 2021 (n = 75 reports). The data showed an increase in reports from July 2021 to July 2022, and the Mann–Kendall trend test showed a significant upward trend (P = 0.015). The most frequently reported illness was hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and the country with the most reports was India.

2023.0,policy planning,"Complexity Science Institute, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China","Background Plasmodium falciparum cases are rising in China due to the imported malaria cases from African countries. The main goal of this study is to examine the impact of imported malaria cases in African countries on the rise of P. falciparum cases in China before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A generalized regression model was used to investigate the association of time trends between imported malaria cases from 45 African countries and P. falciparum cases in 31 provinces of China from 2012 to 2018 before the COVID-19 pandemic and during the COVID-19 pandemic from October 2020 to May 2021. Based on the analysis, we proposed a statistical and deep learning hybrid approach to model the resurgence of malaria in China using monthly data of P. falciparum from 2004 to 2016. This study builds a hybrid model known as the ARIMA-GRU approach for modeling the P. falciparum cases in all provinces of China and the number of malaria deaths in China before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results The analysis showed an emerging link between the rise of imported malaria cases from Africa and P. falciparum cases in many provinces of China. Many imported malaria cases from Africa were P. falciparum cases. The proposed deep learning model achieved a high prediction accuracy score on the testing dataset of 96%. Conclusion The study provided an analysis of the reduction of P. falciparum cases and deaths caused by imported P. falciparum cases during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the control measures regarding the limitation of international travel in China. The Chinese government has to prepare the imported malaria control measures after the normalization of international travel, to prevent the resurgence of malaria disease in China. © 2023 Kamana, Zhao.

Achieving effective treatment and reducing mortality rates hinges on early and accurate diagnosis. In the year 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a staggering 619,000 deaths attributed to malaria. Additionally, approximately 214 million individuals were afflicted by this disease during that period. Hence, this study introduces two distinct deep-learning algorithms tailored for malaria disease classification. The first method employs a binary classifier convolutional neural network (CNN) model, attaining an accuracy (ACC) of 90.20%. The second method introduces a customized CNN model that exhibits even greater ACC, reaching an impressive 96.02%. These advanced deep learning (DL) techniques hold the potential to enhance the precision (PRE) and efficiency of malaria diagnosis, ultimately facilitating early disease detection. The study provides comprehensive insights into the proposed models. Model 1 involves malaria disease classification employing a CNN-based binary classifier, while Model 2 adopts a customized CNN architecture. The methodology section elucidates the details of these models, their design, and the execution of experiments undertaken to evaluate their performance.

We investigated the ability of machine learning to detect DENV based solely on data available at the clinic visit. We extracted symptom and physical exam data from 6,208 pediatric febrile illness visits to Kenyan public health clinics from 2014-2019 and created a dataset with 113 clinical features. Malaria testing was available at the clinic site. DENV testing was performed afterwards. We randomly sampled 70% of the dataset to develop DENV and malaria prediction models using boosted logistic regression, decision trees and random forests, support vector machines, naïve Bayes, and neural networks with 10-fold cross validation, tuned to maximize accuracy. 30% of the dataset was reserved to validate the models. 485 subjects (7.8%) had DENV, and 3,145 subjects (50.7%) had malaria. 220 (3.5%) subjects had co-infection with both DENV and malaria. In the validation dataset, clinician accuracy for diagnosis of malaria was high (82% accuracy, 85% sensitivity, 80% specificity). Accuracy of the models for predicting malaria diagnosis ranged from 53-69% (35-94% sensitivity, 11-80% specificity). In contrast, clinicians detected only 21 of 145 cases of DENV (80% accuracy, 14% sensitivity, 85% specificity). Of the six models, only logistic regression identified any DENV case (8 cases, 91% accuracy, 5.5% sensitivity, 98% specificity). Without diagnostic testing, interpretation of clinical findings by humans or machines cannot detect DENV at 8% prevalence.

Materials and methods: The study was a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a total sample size of 44 patients. The total random number table was used on a computer for randomization. The sample size was divided into either the study group that received pulse MPS therapy along with the standard therapy to manage acute lung injury (ALI)/ARDS or the control group that received a placebo in the form of 100 mL of normal saline with the standard therapy to manage ALI/ARDS. The primary outcome was defined as either death of the patient or discharge from the hospital. The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, the lung injury score (LIS), duration of stay in the medical intensive care unit (MICU), number of days for which mechanical ventilation was required, and the rate of secondary infections between the study and the control groups were also calculated. Statistically significant differences among continuous variables were analyzed by t-test, and differences between categorical variables were assessed by Chi-squared test. Results: A total of 30 patients passed initial screening, out of which 60% were males and 40% were females. About 73.3% of the patients fell between the age groups of 36–45 years. A total of 20 patients (66.7%) were discharged from the hospital, while the remaining 10 patients succumbed to death in the intensive care unit (ICU) (33.3%). The outcome of death or discharge was found to be independent of the use of pulse MPS therapy (p = 0.44). No statistically significant difference was found between the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio, SOFA score, and LIS between the two groups. Furthermore, the differences between the mean duration of stay in the MICU, the mean duration for the provision of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.41), and the rate of secondary infections (p = 0.46) remained unaffected with the use of pulse MPS therapy. Conclusion: Pulse MPS therapy has not shown any clear-cut benefit in the management of malaria-associated ARDS, and in fact, the continuous use of this treatment in hospitals may lead to worsened outcomes.

Furthermore, DL classification is the core of other subfields. Owing to various forms of ensemble models, DL models have achieved state-of-the-art performances in fields such as medicine. However, the existing models cannot solve the problem of generalization perfectly and proposed solutions only for tasks with specific datasets. Most state-of-the-art classification models presented their results in ImageNet dataset, and models elaborate on the insights of the dataset. Nonetheless, model architectures or pretrained models cannot provide the same accurate results for datasets with different classes than ImageNet. Hence, this research proposes an improved convolutional neural network ensemble (ICNN-Ensemble) based on the representation of high-resolution image channels (RHRIC) and a systematic model dropout ensemble (SMDE). ICNN-Ensemble exploits image channels after applying RHRIC and RGB images in their original forms, which accesses more residual feature connections and represents more insight into image channels. Furthermore, SMDE is applied to choose ensemble members, considering the changes of the accurate prediction field (APF) in the ICNN-Ensemble model. In addition, the proposed model executes ensembling during the test set prediction, which allows the model to be trained with larger batches and images compared to ensemble model's final results during training, allowing maximal effective usage of the graphics processing unit (GPU).

Our first objective was to identify health conditions associated with tinnitus in young adults. The second objective was to evaluate the predictive utility of some known risk factors. Study design: A cross-sectional design was used to investigate the prevalence and risk factors for tinnitus. Setting: A questionnaire was distributed, reaching out to a large college-aged population. A total of 2258 young adults aged 18–30 years were recruited from April 2021 to February 2022. Interventions: A questionnaire was administered to investigate the epidemiology of tinnitus in a population of college-aged young adults. Results: About 17.7% of young adults reported bothersome tinnitus perception lasting for ≥5 min in the last 12 months. The prevalence of chronic tinnitus (bothersome tinnitus for ≥1 year) and acute tinnitus (bothersome tinnitus for <1 year) was 10.6% and 7.1%, respectively. About 19% of the study sample reported at least one health condition. Individuals reporting head injury, hypertension, heart disease, scarlet fever, and malaria showed significantly higher odds of reporting chronic tinnitus. Meningitis and self-reported hearing loss showed significant associations with bothersome tinnitus. The prevalence of chronic tinnitus was significantly higher in males reporting high noise exposure, a positive history of reoccurring ear infections, European ethnic background, and a positive health history. Risk modeling showed that noise exposure was the most important risk factor for chronic tinnitus, followed by sex, reoccurring ear infections, and a history of any health condition. A positive history of COVID-19 and self-reported severity showed no association with tinnitus. Individuals reporting reoccurring ear infections showed a significantly higher prevalence of COVID-19. Conclusions: While young adults with health conditions are at a higher risk of reporting tinnitus, the predictive utility of a positive health history remains relatively low, possibly due to weak associations between health conditions and tinnitus. Noise, male sex, reoccurring ear infections, European ethnicity, and a positive health history revealed higher odds of reporting chronic tinnitus than their counterparts. These risk factors collectively explained about 16% variability in chronic tinnitus, which highlights the need for identifying other risk factors for chronic tinnitus in young adults. © 2023 by the authors.",cochlear synaptopathy; COVID-19; epidemiology; noise; prevalence; risk factor; tinnitus; tinnitus phenotypes,"National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, NIDCD, (R21DC016704-01A1); National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, NIDCD",Identifying Health-Related Conditions Associated with Tinnitus in Young Adults,NO

Toward implementing these principles, UBC then identified a set of strategies for providing affordable access to new UBC-developed technologies throughout low- and middle-income countries and among vulnerable populations. In this perspective, we provide an update of UBC’s progress over the past 15 years made on several technologies that fall under the GA principles. The technologies reported on are wide-ranging, including an oral medication for the treatment of leishmaniasis; peptides for potential use against malaria, and various bacterial, viral and fungal infections; a portable vaccine cooler; a diagnostic technology to detect severe sepsis; and an SMS Messaging System to monitor and support patients with HIV, TB and COVID-19. We identify challenges faced by the researchers in implementing the GA principles for these technologies and potential solutions for overcoming them through creative licensing and partnerships with public and private sectors, governments, local companies, and communities. As the UBC example illustrates, universities across the globe have an opportunity to make a significant social impact on improving global health of vulnerable populations and on supporting local infrastructures for sustaining these improvements.

This research seeks to enhance the accuracy of classifying malaria-infected erythrocytes (RBCs) through the fusion of machine learning algorithms, resulting in a hybrid classifier. The primary phases involve data preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and RBC classification. This paper introduces a novel hybrid machine learning algorithm, employing two combinations of supervised algorithms. The initial combination encompasses stochastic gradient descent (SGD), logistic regression, and decision tree, while the second employs stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Xgboost, and random forest. The proposed approach, implemented using Python programming, presents an innovative hybrid machine learning algorithm. Through a comparative analysis between individual algorithms and the proposed hybrid algorithm, the paper demonstrates heightened accuracy in classifying malaria data, thus aiding medical practitioners in diagnosis. Among these algorithms, SGD, logistic regression, and decision tree yield individual accuracy rates of 90.63%, 92.23%, and 93.43%, respectively, while the hybrid algorithm achieves 95.64% accuracy on the same dataset. The second hybrid algorithm, combining SGD, Xgboost, and random forest, outperforms the initial hybrid version. Individually, these algorithms achieve accuracy rates of 90.63%, 95.86%, and 96.11%.

Dengue can result in clinical manifestations with different degrees of severity, dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome. Interferons (IFNs) are antiviral cytokines central to the anti-DENV immune response. Notably, the distinct global signature of type I, II, and III interferon-regulated genes (the interferome) remains uncharacterized in dengue patients to date. Therefore, we performed an in-depth cross-study for the integrative analysis of transcriptome data related to DENV infection. Our systems biology analysis shows that the anti-dengue immune response is characterized by the modulation of numerous interferon-regulated genes (IRGs) enriching, for instance, cytokine-mediated signaling (e.g., type I and II IFNs) and chemotaxis, which is then followed by a transcriptional wave of genes associated with cell cycle, also regulated by the IFN cascade. The adjunct analysis of disease stratification potential, followed by a transcriptional meta-analysis of the interferome, indicated genes such as IFI27, ISG15, and CYBRD1 as potential suitable biomarkers of disease severity. Thus, this study characterizes the landscape of the interferome signature in DENV infection, indicating that interferome dynamics are a crucial and central part of the anti-dengue immune response.

This work evaluated the antileishmanial potential of Brotheas amazonicus and Tityus metuendus venoms against the promastigote forms of Leishmania amazonensis e Leishmania guyanensis. The venoms of B. amazonicus and T. metuendus were evaluated for their constituents using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR). Growth inhibition and death of promastigotes were evaluated in the presence of diferente crude venom concentrations (100 µg/mL, 50 µg/mL, 10 µg/mL, 1 µg/mL) after one hour of incubation at 25 °C. The FTIR spectra of both venoms exhibited bands in approximate regions, revealing that both exhibit similar functional groups.

Commercial samples of hexanal, nonanal, and benzaldehyde were used at 95% purity. The experiments were performed at 25C and 65% relative humidity using two procedures: a glass arena with filter papers impregnated with 1, 5, and 10 mL of the tested compounds and a double-choice olfactometer. Attraction was scored positively if the insect remained more than 30 seconds on one of the surfaces. The results of the study showed that hexanal was attractive to females at higher concentrations (5–10 mL; P, 0.0001), and IV instar nymphs were only attracted at the highest concentration (10 mL; P, 0.01). Nonanal was attractive to IV instar nymphs at 1 and 5 mL (P, 0.0001), whereas males and females were more attracted at 1 mL (P, 0.01 and P, 0.05, respectively). Benzaldehyde showed significant differences with respect to controls, attracting females at low concentrations (1 mL; P, 0.0001) and IV instar nymphs at 5 and 10 mL (P, 0.0001 and P, 0.001, respectively).

The ML analysis showed a close relation with the Caucasian samples, and some haplotypes are specific to this region. Our results suggest that Turkish Ae. aegypti strains might have been a mix of Asian and American strains. The differences between Turkish and Georgian samples were statistically insignificant and values of difference were very low according to AMOVA.

Malaria surveillance methods capture active or recent infections which poses several challenges to achieving malaria surveillance goals. In high transmission settings, asymptomatic infections are common and therefore accurate measurement of malaria burden demands active surveillance; in low transmission regions where infections are rare accurate surveillance requires sampling large subsets of the population; and in any context monitoring malaria burden over time necessitates serial sampling. Antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum parasites persist after infection and therefore measuring antibodies has the potential to overcome several of the current obstacles to accurate malaria surveillance. Identifying which antibody responses are markers of the timing and intensity of past exposure to P. falciparum remains challenging, particularly among adults who tend to be re-exposed multiple times over the course of their lifetime and therefore have similarly high antibody responses to many Plasmodium antigens. A previous analysis of 479 serum samples from individuals in three regions in southern Africa with different historical levels of P. falciparum malaria transmission (high, intermediate, and low) revealed regional differences in antibody responses to P. falciparum antigens among children under 5 years of age. Using a novel bioinformatic pipeline optimized for protein microarrays that minimizes between-sample technical variation, we used antibody responses to Plasmodium antigens as predictors in random forest models to classify samples from adults into these three regions of differing historical malaria transmission with high accuracy (AUC = 0.99). Many of the most important antigens for classification in these models do not overlap with previously published results and are therefore novel candidate markers for the timing and intensity of past exposure to P. falciparum. Measuring antibody responses to these antigens could lead to improved malaria surveillance. Copyright: © 2023 Bérubé et al.

In this study, we used the TCGA dataset as the training queue and GSE13041, GSE43378, GSE4412, and CGGA datasets as the external validation queue. Based on machine algorithms and bioinformatics methods, an exosome-generalized risk score was established. We found that the risk score could independently predict the prognosis of patients with glioma, and there were significant differences in the outcomes of patients in the high- and low-risk groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that risk score is a valid predictive biomarker for gliomas. Two immunotherapy datasets, IMvigor210 and GSE78220, were obtained from previous studies. A high-risk score showed a significant association with multiple immunomodulators that could act on cancer immune evasion. The exosome-related risk score could predict the effectiveness of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.

The increasing resistance to the available trypanocidal drugs necessitates the need for the discovery of newer and more efficient drug. Therefore, the aim is to screen three important Nigerian ethnomedicinal plants for antitrypanosomal potential. Fifty microliter of 20, 10 and 0.1 µg/µL each of the crude methanol extract of Acacia nilotica, Terminalia avicennioides and Tamarindus indica, and diminazene aceturate was mixed with 50 µL of Trypanosome congolense-laden blood (TC-LB) (8.6×107 cells per mL of blood) and incubated at 25°C for 5 h. Similarly, wells with 2% tween 80 and TC-LB only served as negative and untreated controls, respectively. The experiment was carried out in triplicate. The contents of each well were inoculated into mice at score 0 and at the end of the experiment for concentrations that did not produce score 0. Phytochemical constituents of each extract were detected by thin-layer chromatography. T. avicennioides and A. nilotica reached score 0 within 3 and 5 h, respectively, and did not produce infection in the inoculated mice. However, T. indica produced significant (P < 0.05) reduction in parasite motility at the highest concentration compared to negative control. Alkaloids, phenols, steroids and triterpenes were detected in the three plants. Additionally, T. avicennioides also contained anthraquinones. Thus, the plants, particularly T. avicennioides and A. nilotica offer prospects for the discovery of new antitrypanosomal drugs. © 2023 Tauheed et al.",Drug discovery; medicinal plant; phytochemical screening; trypanocidal; Trypanosomal congolense,,"Phytochemistry and Antitrypanosomal Effects of Acacia nilotica, Tamarindus indica and Terminalia avicennioides Using Drug Incubation Infectivity Test",NO

A computer aided framework is proposed in this study to assist and support the GPs to diagnose RA better. In this work Improved Harmony Search Optimization (IHSO) approach is proposed to select the significant feature subset of RA and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is used as a classification model. The performance of the proposed IHSO-ANFIS model is examined with metrics such as Balanced Accuracy (Bacc), Area under Curve (AUC), Sensitivity (Sen), Specificity (Spec), and Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC) using 10-Fold cross-validation. Additionally, the results of the IHSO-ANFIS are compared with HSO-ANFIS, ANFIS without any feature selection and standard bench mark datasets. IHSO-ANFIS attained 87.05% Bacc, 89.95% AUC and 0.6586 MCC on the RA dataset. From the results it is clear that IHSO-ANFIS could assist general physicians to diagnose RA earlier and pave the way for timely treatment.  © 2023 - IOS Press.

The affected individuals suffer from malfunctioning of one or more of the four globin genes, leading to chronic hemolytic anemia, an imbalance in the hemoglobin chain ratio, iron overload, and ineffective erythropoiesis. Despite the challenges posed by this condition, recent years have witnessed significant advancements in diagnosis, therapy, and transfusion support, significantly improving the prognosis for thalassemia patients. This research empirically evaluates the efficacy of models constructed using classification methods and explores the effectiveness of relevant features that are derived using various machine-learning techniques. Five feature selection approaches, namely Chi-Square (χ2), Exploratory Factor Score (EFS), tree-based Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), gradient-based RFE, and Linear Regression Coefficient, were employed to determine the optimal feature set. Nine classifiers, namely K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC), Linear Regression (LR), AdaBoost, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Random Forest (RF), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were utilized to evaluate the performance. The χ2 method achieved accuracy, registering 91.56% precision, 91.04% recall, and 92.65% f-score when aligned with the LR classifier. Moreover, the results underscore that amalgamating over-sampling with Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), RFE, and 10-fold cross-validation markedly elevates the detection accuracy for αT patients. Notably, the Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) achieves 93.46% accuracy, 93.89% recall, and 92.72% F1 score. © 2023 by the authors.",classification; feature selection; filter-based; thalassemia; wrapper and embedded method,"King Saud University, KSU, (RSP2023R164); King Saud University, KSU",Predicting Thalassemia Using Feature Selection Techniques: A Comparative Analysis,YES

Consequently, the addition of automated detection and classification of malaria using laboratory methods can provide patients with more accurate and faster diagnosis. Therefore, this study used a machine-learning model to predict Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) antigen positivity (presence of malaria) based on sociodemographic behaviour, environment, and clinical features. Method: Data from 200 Nigerian patients were used to develop predictive models using nested cross-validation and sequential backward feature selection (SBFS), with 80% of the dataset randomly selected for training and optimisation and the remaining 20% for testing the models. Outcomes were classified as Pf-positive or Pf-negative, corresponding to the presence or absence of malaria, respectively. Results: Among the three machine learning models examined, the penalised logistic regression model had the best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the training set (AUC = 84%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 75–93%) and test set (AUC = 83%; 95% CI: 63–100%). Increased odds of malaria were associated with higher body weight (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 4.50, 95% CI: 2.27 to 8.01, p < 0.0001). Even though the association between the odds of having malaria and body temperature was not significant, patients with high body temperature had higher odds of testing positive for the Pf antigen than those who did not have high body temperature (AOR = 1.40, 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.91, p = 0.068). In addition, patients who had bushes in their surroundings (AOR = 2.60, 95% CI: 1.30 to 4.66, p = 0.006) or experienced fever (AOR = 2.10, 95% CI: 0.88 to 4.24, p = 0.099), headache (AOR = 2.07; 95% CI: 0.95 to 3.95, p = 0.068), muscle pain (AOR = 1.49; 95% CI: 0.66 to 3.39, p = 0.333), and vomiting (AOR = 2.32; 95% CI: 0.85 to 6.82, p = 0.097) were more likely to experience malaria. In contrast, decreased odds of malaria were associated with age (AOR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.90, p = 0.012) and BMI (AOR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.80, p = 0.006).

Its emergence and recurrence pose a constant challenge to the elimination of schistosomiasis in China. It is important to accurately predict the snail distribution for schistosomiasis prevention and control. Methods: Data describing the distribution of O. hupensis in 2016 was obtained from the Yunnan Institute of Endemic Disease Control and Prevention. Eight machine learning algorithms, including eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), generalized boosting model (GBM), neural network (NN), classification and regression trees (CART), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and generalized additive model (GAM), were employed to explore the impacts of climatic, geographical, and socioeconomic variables on the distribution of suitable areas for O. hupensis. Predictions of the distribution of suitable areas for O. hupensis were made for various periods (2030s, 2050s, and 2070s) under different climate scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585). Results: The RF model exhibited the best performance (AUC: 0.991, sensitivity: 0.982, specificity: 0.995, kappa: 0.942) and the CART model performed the worst (AUC: 0.884, sensitivity: 0.922, specificity: 0.943, kappa: 0.829). Based on the RF model, the top six important variables were as follows: Bio15 (precipitation seasonality) (33.6%), average annual precipitation (25.2%), Bio2 (mean diurnal temperature range) (21.7%), Bio19 (precipitation of the coldest quarter) (14.5%), population density (13.5%), and night light index (11.1%). The results demonstrated that the overall suitable habitats for O. hupensis were predominantly distributed in the schistosomiasis-endemic areas located in northwestern Yunnan Province under the current climate situation and were predicted to expand north- and westward due to climate change. Conclusions: This study showed that the prediction of the current distribution of O. hupensis corresponded well with the actual records. Furthermore, our study provided compelling evidence that the geographical distribution of snails was projected to expand toward the north and west of Yunnan Province in the coming decades, indicating that the distribution of snails is driven by climate factors. Our findings will be of great significance for formulating effective strategies for snail control.

Several genetic and non-genetic risk factors for LR have been described; however, there are limited attempts to combine this information to estimate the risk of a leprosy patient developing LR. Here we present an artificial intelligence (AI)-based system that can assess LR risk using clinical, demographic, and genetic data. Methods: The study includes four datasets from different regions of Brazil, totalizing 1,450 leprosy patients followed prospectively for at least 2 years to assess the occurrence of LR. Data mining using WEKA software was performed following a two-step protocol to select the variables included in the AI system, based on Bayesian Networks, and developed using the NETICA software. Results: Analysis of the complete database resulted in a system able to estimate LR risk with 82.7% accuracy, 79.3% sensitivity, and 86.2% specificity. When using only databases for which host genetic information associated with LR was included, the performance increased to 87.7% accuracy, 85.7% sensitivity, and 89.4% specificity. Conclusion: We produced an easy-to-use, online, free-access system that identifies leprosy patients at risk of developing LR. Risk assessment of LR for individual patients may detect candidates for close monitoring, with a potentially positive impact on the prevention of permanent disabilities, the quality of life of the patients, and upon leprosy control programs.

Towards building momentum to address this challenge, we investigated the perception of medical and para-medical students about FGS, as well as the expertise of health care professionals in Anambra State, Nigeria. Methodology We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 587 female medical and para-medical university students (MPMS), and 65 health care professionals (HCPs) saddled with the respon-sibility of delivering care for schistosomiasis-affected persons. Pretested questionnaires were administered to document the awareness and knowledge about the disease. In addi-tion, the expertise of HCPs vis-à-vis suspicion of FGS and management of FGS patients during routine health care service were documented. Data were subjected to descriptive, chi-square tests and regression analysis in R software. Results Over half of the students recruited; 54.2% for schistosomiasis and 58.1% for FGS, were not aware of the disease. Knowledge about schistosomiasis was associated with student’s year of study, with those in 2nd (OR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.0, 2.7), 4th (OR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.2, 3.2), and 6th (OR: 5.05, 95% CI: 1.2, 34.2) year having higher likelihoods of been more informed about schistosomiasis. For HCPs, we observed a contrastingly high knowledge about schistosomiasis (96.9%), but low knowledge about FGS (61.9%). Knowledge for both schis-tosomiasis and FGS was not associated with year of practice and expertise (95% OR included 1, p > 0.05). A considerable proportion (>40%) of the HCPs never suspected schis-tosomiasis during routine clinical diagnosis of patients who presented probable FGS symptoms (p < 0.05). Similarly, only 20% were certain about the use of praziquantel for treating FGS, and about 35% were uncertain of the eligibility criteria and dosage regimens. Com-modities for managing FGS were also largely unavailable in about 39% of the health facili-ties where the HCPs operate. Conclusion Awareness and knowledge about FGS among MPMS and HCPs were poor in Anambra, Nigeria. It is therefore important to invest in innovative methods of building capacity of MPMS and HCPs, with complementary provision of necessary diagnostics to perform colposcopy, as well as competence to diagnose pathognomonic lesions using diagnostic atlas or Artificial Intelligence (AI). © 2023 Aribodor et al.",,Geneva Learning Foundation,"Profiling the knowledge of female medical/ para-medical students, and expertise of health care professionals on female genital schistosomiasis in Anambra, South Eastern Nigeria",NO

This study aimed to develop deep learning models with high-resolution remote sensing images for recognizing and monitoring livestock bovine, which is an intermediate source of Schistosoma japonicum infection, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the models for real-world application. Methods: The dataset of livestock bovine’s spatial distribution was collected from the Chinese National Platform for Common Geospatial Information Services. The high-resolution remote sensing images were further divided into training data, test data, and validation data for model development. Two recognition models based on deep learning methods (ENVINet5 and Mask R-CNN) were developed with reference to the training datasets. The performance of the developed models was evaluated by the performance metrics of precision, recall, and F1-score. Results: A total of 50 typical image areas were selected, 1125 bovine objectives were labeled by the ENVINet5 model and 1277 bovine objectives were labeled by the Mask R-CNN model. For the ENVINet5 model, a total of 1598 records of bovine distribution were recognized. The model precision and recall were 81.9% and 80.2%, respectively. The F1 score was 0.81. For the Mask R-CNN mode, 1679 records of bovine objectives were identified. The model precision and recall were 87.3% and 85.2%, respectively. The F1 score was 0.87. When applying the developed models to real-world schistosomiasis-endemic regions, there were 63 bovine objectives in the original image, 53 records were extracted using the ENVINet5 model, and 57 records were extracted using the Mask R-CNN model. The successful recognition ratios were 84.1% and 90.5% for the respectively developed models. Conclusion: The ENVINet5 model is very feasible when the bovine distribution is low in structure with few samples. The Mask R-CNN model has a good framework design and runs highly efficiently. The livestock recognition models developed using deep learning methods with high-resolution remote sensing images accurately recognize the spatial distribution of livestock, which could enable precise control of schistosomiasis.

While most malaria diagnostic tools are focused on Plasmodium falciparum, there is a current lack of testing non-P. falciparum cases, which may be underreported and, if undiagnosed or untreated, may lead to severe consequences. In this work, seven species-specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays were designed and evaluated against TaqMan quantitative PCR (qPCR), microscopy, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Their clinical performance was assessed with a cohort of 164 samples of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients from Ghana. All asymptomatic samples with a parasite load above 80 genomic DNA (gDNA) copies per mL of extracted sample were detected with the Plasmodium falciparum LAMP assay, reporting 95.6% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] of 89.9 to 98.5) sensitivity and 100% (95% CI of 87.2 to 100) specificity. This assay showed higher sensitivity than microscopy and ELISA, which were 52.7% (95% CI of 39.7 to 67%) and 67.3% (95% CI of 53.3 to 79.3%), respectively. Nine samples were positive for P. malariae, indicating coinfections with P. falciparum, which represented 5.5% of the tested population. No samples were detected as positive for P. vivax, P. ovale, P. knowlesi, or P. cynomolgi by any method. Furthermore, translation to the point-of-care was demonstrated with a subcohort of 18 samples tested locally in Ghana using our handheld lab-on-chip platform, Lacewing, showing comparable results to a conventional fluorescence-based instrument. The developed molecular diagnostic test could detect asymptomatic malaria cases, including submicroscopic parasitemia, and it has the potential to be used for point-of-care applications. IMPORTANCE The spread of Plasmodium falciparum parasites with Pfhrp2/3 gene deletions presents a major threat to reliable point-of-care diagnosis with current rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Novel molecular diagnostics based on nucleic acid amplification are needed to address this liability. In this work, we overcome this challenge by developing sensitive tools for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum and non-P. falciparum species. Furthermore, we evaluate these tools with a cohort of symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria patients and test a subcohort locally in Ghana. The findings of this work could lead to the implementation of DNA-based diagnostics to fight against the spread of malaria and provide reliable, sensitive, and specific diagnostics at the point of care.

Here we evaluated the serum soluble IL-2R levels as potential biomarker for identifying HLH in patients with dengue fever. Methods: In this cross-sectional study conducted in a tertiary care center of a teaching hospital, subjects with dengue and fever of more than 5 days, leukopenia/thrombocytopenia and/or hepatosplenomegaly were studied. Data were collected to compare sIL-2R values and serum ferritin with Hscore and Histiocyte Society 2004 criteria. Relevant statistical methods were used. Results: 80 subjects with severe dengue fever were analyzed with relevant investigations. Mean H score was 219.2 ± 17.6 in 18 dengue patients with HLH v/s 166.2 ± 11.2 in 62 patients without HLH (p = < 0.001). Serum ferritin (11,230.5 v/s 7853.5, p = 0.013) and sIL-2R (32,917.5 v/s 6210, p = < 0.001) were significantly higher in those patients with HLH. sIL-2R correlated very well with HScore (r = 0.98, p < 0.001) compared to ferritin (r = 0.51, p < 0.001) with an AUROC of 1.00 compared to 0.694 (95% CI 0.557–0.831) of serum ferritin for diagnosing HLH. A cut-off value of 10,345 pg/ml for sIL-2R had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% for HLH, whereas, a ferritin value of 8613 ng/ml had only 67% sensitivity and 55% specificity. Conclusion: sIL-2R could be a single most useful biomarker to differentiate dengue fever patients who are likely to progress to HLH, from those that are not.

Ross River virus (RRV) is endemic in Australia and has epidemic potential. In Malaysia, Aedes mosquitoes are abundant and drive dengue and chikungunya outbreaks. We assessed risk of an RRV outbreak in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia by determining vector competence of local Aedes mosquitoes and local seroprevalence as a proxy of human population susceptibility. Methodology/Principal findings We assessed oral susceptibility of Malaysian Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus by real-time PCR to an Australian RRV strain SW2089. Replication kinetics in midgut, head and saliva were determined at 3 and 10 days post-infection (dpi). With a 3 log10 PFU/ml blood meal, infection rate was higher in Ae. albopictus (60%) than Ae. aegypti (15%; p<0.05). Despite similar infection rates at 5 and 7 log10 PFU/ml blood meals, Ae. albopictus had significantly higher viral loads and required a significantly lower median oral infectious dose (2.7 log10 PFU/ml) than Ae. aegypti (4.2 log10 PFU/ml). Ae. albopictus showed higher vector compe-tence, with higher viral loads in heads and saliva, and higher transmission rate (RRV present in saliva) of 100% at 10 dpi, than Ae. aegypti (41%). Ae. aegypti demonstrated greater barriers at either midgut escape or salivary gland infection, and salivary gland escape. We then assessed seropositivity against RRV among 240 Kuala Lumpur inpatients using plaque reduction neutralization, and found a low rate of 0.8%. Conclusions/Significance Both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus are susceptible to RRV, but Ae. albopictus displays greater vector competence. Extensive travel links with Australia, abundant Aedes vectors, and low population immunity places Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia at risk of an imported RRV out-break.

This disease predominantly plagues developing nations, with Thailand being no exception. In the current global landscape, concerted efforts are being mobilized to curb human mortalities attributed to animal-transmitted rabies. For strategic allocation and optimization of resources, sophisticated and accurate forecasting of rabies incidents is imperative. This research aims to determine temporal patterns, and seasonal fluctuations, and project the incidence of canine rabies throughout Thailand, using various time series techniques. Methods: Monthly total laboratory-confirmed rabies cases data from January 2013 to December 2022 (full dataset) were split into the training dataset (January 2013 to December 2021) and the test dataset (January to December 2022). Time series models including Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), Neural Network Autoregression (NNAR), Error Trend Seasonality (ETS), the Trigonometric Exponential Smoothing State-Space Model with Box-Cox transformation, ARMA errors, Trend and Seasonal components (TBATS), and Seasonal and Trend Decomposition using Loess (STL) were used to analyze the training dataset and the full dataset. The forecast values obtained from the time series models applied to the training dataset were compared with the actual values from the test dataset to determine their predictive performance. Furthermore, the forecast projections from January 2023 to December 2025 were generated from models applied to the full dataset. Results: The findings revealed a total of 4,678 confirmed canine rabies cases during the study duration, with apparent seasonality in the data. Among the models tested with the test dataset, TBATS exhibited superior predictive accuracy, closely trailed by the SARIMA model. Based on the full dataset, TBATS projections suggest an annual average of approximately 285 canine rabies cases for the years 2023 to 2025, translating to a monthly average of 23 cases (range: 18–30). In contrast, SARIMA projections averaged 277 cases annually (range: 208–214). Discussion: This research offers a new perspective on disease forecasting through advanced time series methodologies. The results should be taken into consideration when planning and conducting rabies surveillance, prevention, and control activities.

Screening blood smears for malaria parasite has a sensitivity of 75 %, and requires intensive training of the laboratory technician. In the present study, we have attempted to develop an artificial intelligence to automate the process of malaria parasite detection. Methods: We acquired 352 images of Leishman–Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smears, containing either normal red blood cells (RBCs) or parasitised RBCs. With a trial and error approach, we developed five deep learning models: (A) Naive deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for trophozoites, (B) Modified Inception V3 pretrained neural network (C) Combination of model A and B, (D) Segmentation of cells from the images through Watershed Transform and naive tri-class DCNN (normal RBCs, parasitised RBCs, WBC/platelets), and (E) A naive DCNN model to detect ring forms. The images were randomly split into training and test sets and training was imparted on all the models. After completion of training, performance of each model was assessed on the test set. Results: Overall, the best combination of sensitivity and specificity was seen in model D (85 % and 94 %, respectively) in detecting parasites; in addition to trophozoites, model D could also detect ring forms. The performance of model A, B & C suffered from lack of either sensitivity or specificity.

More than 2 billion humans live in dengue susceptible regions with an annual infection mortality rate is about 5%–20%. At the initial stages, it is difficult to differentiate dengue fever symptoms from other similar diseases. Therefore, early diagnosis of dengue disease can help in protecting human lives by making a preventive move before it turns into an infectious disease. Although early detection is critical to reducing dengue disease deaths, accurate dengue diagnosis requires a long time due to the numerous clinical examinations. For this, several techniques have been presented. But, the accuracy of these methods is not enough. Thus, this issue necessitates the development of a new diagnostic schema. Hence, to identify the dengue-affected blood samples effectively, Updated Chimp Optimization Algorithm-Artificial Neural Network (UChOA-ANN) based diagnostic model is proposed in this paper. UChOA-ANN-based diagnostic model has been implemented and validated for the early detection and accurate prediction of dengue disease. Here, to improve the performance of ANN, UChOA is used for selecting the weight parameters of ANN optimally. The results show that the proposed diagnostic model has achieved maximum sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy at 92%, 96%, and 94%, respectively. In addition, the results reveal that the proposed diagnostic model has outperformed other methods for detecting dengue-affected blood samples in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, NPV, FPR, FNR, and FDR.

Traditional diagnosis of malaria involves examination of thin blood smear slides under a microscope by trained microscopists to detect infected blood cells. This process is expensive, and results depend both on the quality of smear and on the expertise of the microscopist. Thus, work done in this field is focussed on automating this detection of infected cells. Early work for this task included using hand-engineered features and machine learning algorithms. This approach was taken over by the advent of CNNs which provided an end-to-end solution, right from feature extraction to classification. Work done in this field thus shifted towards using state-of-the-art CNNs. The authors of this paper found that most of the existing models that had been used for this problem had good classification accuracy but had big sizes that could not be run on a normal computing device. They identified that a new set of state-of-the-art CNNs, called EfficientNets which promised similar performance at much smaller sizes, had not been used for this task.

This paper presents a transparent approach to malaria diagnosis by applying Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, namely Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME), to provide meaningful interpretations of severe malaria predictions made by machine learning models. Various models, including Extreme Gradient Boosting, K-means, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest, Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, and Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs) are deployed for this task. The results of the study showed that Random Forest and Explainable Boosting Machines achieved the highest accuracy of 84%.

This is exacerbated by the lack of intelligent models for predicting, mapping, diagnosing, and detecting malaria to strengthen malaria prevention and control measures. Predicting malaria and understanding risk factors leading to malaria outbreaks can assist policymakers in re-strategizing and re-aligning malaria elimination strategies and optimizing resource allocation by prioritizing malaria-endemic areas. Therefore, this study provides a comprehensive review of machine learning techniques applied to predict malaria using various risk factors. The study revealed that despite the distribution of mosquito nets, indoor spraying of insecticides, community engagement programmes and awareness strategies, socioeconomic factors, climate and environmental conditions significantly contribute towards malaria outbreaks and remain underexploited and poorly understood. Socioeconomic factors such as lower income, living conditions with house type, distance to health facilities, availability, and use of mosquito nets influence malaria outbreaks. Climatic and environmental risk factors including land surface temperature, rainfall, humidity, enhanced vegetation index, normalized difference vegetation index, and normalized difference water index significantly influence malaria incidences.

In order to increase model generalization and solve the lack of labeled data, data augmentation structures including rotation, flipping, and scaling are used to extract more varied samples from the existing pictures. The findings show that the CNN model, in conjunction with data augmentation, achieves good accuracy and achievement in differentiating among 'Parasitized' and 'Uninfected' blood smear pictures.

However, their precision is dependent on the quality of the smear and experience in categorising and counting parasitized and uninfected cells. Such an investigation could be complicated and time-consuming for large-scale diagnosis, resulting in poor quality as well.

While dengue fever rarely results in serious complications, the more severe illness dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) has a significant mortality rate due to the associated plasma leakage. Proper care thus requires identifying patients with DHF among those with suspected dengue so that they can be provided with adequate and prompt fluid replacement. In this paper, we use 18 years of pediatric patient data collected prospectively from two hospitals in Thailand to develop models to predict DHF among patients with suspected dengue. The best model using pooled data from both hospitals achieved an AUC of 0.92. We then investigate the generalizability of the models by constructing a model for one hospital and testing it on the other, a question that has not yet been adequately explored in the literature on DHF prediction. For some models, we find significant degradation in performance. We show this is due to differences in attribute values among the two hospital patient populations. Possible sources of this are differences in the definition of attributes and differences in the pathogenesis of the disease among the two sub-populations.

The diagnostic, performed through parasitological examination, is very tiring and error-prone; simultaneously, it is a step with a great capacity for automation. Therefore, this work aims to develop an automatic system based on computer vision capable of diagnosing patients infected with VL through medical images. We compared the results obtained in this study with related works, where it was possible to observe that the methodology implemented here proved superior and more efficient, reaching an Accuracy of 99%.

Little research has evaluated physiologic effects of maintenance-only fluid strategy. DESIGN: We describe the efficacy of fluid-conservative resuscitation of septic shock using case-fatality, hemodynamic, and myocardial function endpoints. SETTING: Pediatric wards of Mbale Regional Referral Hospital, Uganda, and Kilifi County Hospital, Kenya, conducted between October 2013 and July 2015. Data were analysed from August 2016 to July 2019. PATIENTS: Children (≥ 60 d to ≤ 12 yr) with severe febrile illness and clinical signs of impaired perfusion. INTERVENTIONS: IV maintenance fluid (4 mL/kg/hr) unless children had World Health Organization (WHO) defined shock (≥ 3 signs) where they received two fluid boluses (20 mL/kg) and transfusion if shock persisted. Clinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and laboratory data were collected at presentation, during resuscitation and on day 28. Outcome measures were 48-hour mortality, normalization of hemodynamics, and cardiac biomarkers. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirty children (70% males) were recruited, six had WHO shock, all of whom died (6/6) versus three of 24 deaths in the non-WHO shock. Median fluid volume received by survivors and nonsurvivors were similar (13 [interquartile range (IQR), 9-32] vs 30 mL/kg [28-61 mL/kg], z = 1.62, p = 0.23). By 24 hours, we observed increases in median (IQR) stroke volume index (39 mL/m2[32-42 mL/m2] to 47 mL/m2[41-49 mL/m2]) and a measure of systolic function: fractional shortening from 30 (27-33) to 34 (31-38) from baseline including children managed with no-bolus. Children with WHO shock had a higher mean level of cardiac troponin (t = 3.58; 95% CI, 1.24-1.43; p = 0.02) and alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide (t = 16.5; 95% CI, 2.80-67.5; p < 0.01) at admission compared with non-WHO shock. Elevated troponin (> 0.1 μg/mL) and hyperlactatemia (> 4 mmol/L) were putative makers predicting outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance-only fluid therapy normalized clinical and myocardial perturbations in shock without compromising cardiac or hemodynamic function whereas fluid-bolus management of WHO shock resulted in high fatality.

In the current investigation, data on IL-4 levels in patients with severe and uncomplicated malaria were compiled. Methods: The systematic review was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42022323387). Searches for relevant articles on IL-4 levels in patients with severe malaria and studies that examined IL-4 levels in both uncomplicated malaria and healthy controls were performed in PubMed, Embase, and Scopus using the search strategy without limitation to publication years or language. The quality of all included studies was evaluated using The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement: standards for reporting observational studies. Qualitative and quantitative data syntheses were performed. The random-effects model, which weights each study according to its between- and within-study variance, was used to pool the mean difference (MD) of individual studies. The degree of heterogeneity was determined using Cochran's Q and I2 statistics. Additionally, meta-regression and subgroup analyses were perfomed to investigate possible sources of heterogeneity. The outliers were identified using the leave-one-out method and assessed publication bias using funnel plots, Egger’s test, and a contour-enhanced funnel plot. Results: A total of 2300 studies were identified through database searches, and 36 were included for analyses. The meta-analysis results showed lower mean IL-4 levels in severe malaria (434 cases) than in uncomplicated malaria (611 cases) (P = 0.01, pooled MD: −3.36 pg/mL, 95% confidence intervals CI −5.55 to −1.16 pg/mL, I2: 98.15%, 11 studies). The meta-analysis results showed no difference in mean IL-4 levels between cerebral malaria (96 cases) and noncerebral severe malaria (108 cases) (P = 0.71, pooled MD: 0.86 pg/mL, 95% CI −3.60 to 5.32 pg/mL, I2 92.13%, four studies). Finally, no difference was found in mean IL-4 levels between uncomplicated malaria (635 cases) and healthy controls (674 cases) (P = 0.57, pooled MD: 0.79 pg/mL, 95% CI −1.92 to 3.50 pg/mL, I2: 99.89%, 11 studies). Conclusion: The meta-analysis revealed lower IL-4 levels in patients with severe malaria than in those with uncomplicated malaria, though a trend toward comparable IL-4 levels between both groups was more likely because several sources of heterogeneities were observed. Based on the limited number of studies included in the meta-analysis, until additional investigations have been conducted, IL-4 consideration as an alternative prognostic factor for malaria severity is not warranted. © 2022, The Author(s).",Cerebral malaria; IL-4; Immune response; Interleukin-4; Severe malaria,,A systematic review and meta-analysis of blood interleukin-4 levels concerning malaria infection and severity,NO

Annually, the deaths due to malaria have crossed millions, the countries with fewer medical facilities are the ones which are most affected, thus the prediction of its outbreak at early stages will reduce the intense diminishing of human lives. This systematic investigation deals with the analysis and prediction of the malarial epidemic outbreak by investigating several factors such as climate, global warming, human activities, mosquitoes, sewage, etc., with malarial incidence. The first stage includes data collection by the passive surveillance system; the second stage includes establishing relationships among the climatic factors with malarial incidence and finally predicting using machine learning classifiers. In the analysis, the adaptive boosted J48 (AB-J48) decision tree machine learning classifier outperformed other classifiers under the study with an accuracy of 95% in establishing a relationship among climatic factors with malarial incidence.

The diagnosis of these parasitic diseases is done through physiological symptoms and fecal examination. Often, few professionals are available and able to perform this type of examination, which is considered time-consuming, requires trained personnel, prone to errors, and can cause eye strain in the specialist. In this paper, we investigate the use of the faster R-CNN object detection method to identify eggs of Schistosoma mansoni, forming a system to aid decision making in the diagnosis of fecal examination. A real database was built with 66 images prepared by the Kato–Katz method. Online and offline data augmentation techniques were used to obtain a larger number of samples. As a result, the proposed solution reached an average precision value of 0.765 for an IoU (intersection over union) of 0.50.

These species are contained in the genera Anopheles, Culex, Aedes. Mosquito-borne diseases pose significant threat to public health. Therefore, vector surveillance and vector control strategies are crucial. Automation of genera identification is essential to implement effective vector control strategies. In the past decade several machine learning and deep learning models have been investigated for image-based automatic and accurate classification of vector mosquitoes. Such applications also aid entomologists in insect identification task. In this study, a deep convolutional neural network technique to classify two genera of mosquitoes: Aedes and Culex based on the morphological features is proposed. In our work, an optimization technique i.e., transfer learning using the pretrained deep learning models has been employed. Transfer learning saves the model training time and addresses the problem of low performance due to insufficient amount of training data. This paper presents the architecture of three state of the art pretrained neural networks, including VGGNet, ResNet and GoogLeNet.

Circulating levels of cytokines: IL-1β, TNFα, IL-10, IL6, IL-8 and IL-12 were determined and investigated regarding their association with hemodynamic parameters, clinical signs of heart failure and outcome. Chagas is still a neglected disease that affects numerous individuals, many of them in their most productive years. CCC with left ventricular dysfunction is the most severe presentation of Chagas Disease. BNP is a well-recognized prognostic and clinical biomarker, not only in chronic heart failure patients but also in patients with CCC. Previous studies have shown Ca-125, C-reactive protein, and uric acid to be potentially good prognostic markers in heart failure (HF). Fifty patients with left ventricular fraction less (LVEF) than 55% were selected and followed for a mean period of 18 ± 8.3 months. Patient’s mean age was 43.42 ± 10.3 years (32 male), their BNP was 293 (160–530) pg/mL, Ca-125 8.5 (5.5–16.75) U/mL, uric acid 6.2 ± 2 mg/dL, and C- reactive protein 4.5 (4.5–7.3) mg/L. Patients who had LVEF less than 35% had higher BNP (p = 0.0023), Ca-125 (p = 0.027) and uric acid (p = 0.01) serum levels. Patients who died also showed higher BNP (p = 0.01), uric acid (p = 0.05) and a trend towards higher Ca-125 serum levels (p = 0.056). All markers: BNP, Ca-125, uric acid and C-reactive had good predictability of death in Cox-regression univariate analysis, however, not on the final multivariate model. Of the inflammatory cytokines, IL-8 and IL-12 showed a relation to LVEF of less than 35%. IL-12 was related to adverse cardiovascular events and non-survival. IL-1β was a good predictor of mortality in the final Cox regression model. Determination of Ca-125, uric acid levels and C-reactive protein may add useful clinical and prognostic information and may help clinical decision making for patients with CCC. © 2022 by the authors.",biomakers; Chagas cardiomyopathy; cytokines,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento ientífico e Tecnológico, (480104/2010-7); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq",Biomakers in Chronic Chagas Cardiomyopathy,NO

One of the major impediments to effective malaria control is a lack of accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. This study was conducted to assess clinical malaria incidence and treatment seeking profiles of febrile cases in western Kenya. Methods: Active case detection of malaria was carried out in three eco-epidemiologically distinct zones topologically characterized as lakeshore, hillside, and highland plateau in Kisumu County, western Kenya, from March 2020 to March 2021. Community Health Volunteers (CHVs) conducted biweekly visits to residents in their households to interview and examine for febrile illness. A febrile case was defined as an individual having fever (axillary temperature ≥ 37.5 °C) during examination or complaints of fever and other nonspecific malaria related symptoms 1–2 days before examination. Prior to the biweekly malaria testing by the CHVs, the participants' treatment seeking methods were based on their behaviors in response to febrile illness. In suspected malaria cases, finger-prick blood samples were taken and tested for malaria parasites with ultra-sensitive Alere® malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for quality control examination. Results: Of the total 5838 residents interviewed, 2205 residents had high temperature or reported febrile illness in the previous two days before the visit. Clinical malaria incidence (cases/1000people/month) was highest in the lakeshore zone (24.3), followed by the hillside (18.7) and the highland plateau zone (10.3). Clinical malaria incidence showed significant difference across gender (χ2 = 7.57; df = 2, p = 0.0227) and age group (χ2 = 58.34; df = 4, p < 0.0001). Treatment seeking patterns of malaria febrile cases showed significant difference with doing nothing (48.7%) and purchasing antimalarials from drug shops (38.1%) being the most common health-seeking pattern among the 2205 febrile residents (χ2 = 21.875; df = 4, p < 0.0001). Caregivers of 802 school-aged children aged 5–14 years with fever primarily sought treatment from drug shops (28.9%) and public hospitals (14.0%), with significant lower proportions of children receiving treatment from traditional medication (2.9%) and private hospital (4.4%) (p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in care givers' treatment seeking patterns for feverish children under the age of five (p = 0.086). Residents with clinical malaria cases in the lakeshore and hillside zones sought treatment primarily from public hospitals (61.9%, 60/97) traditional medication (51.1%, 23/45) respectively (p < 0.0001). However, there was no significant difference in the treatment seeking patterns of highland plateau residents with clinical malaria (p = 0.431).The main factors associated with the decision to seek treatment were the travel distance to the health facility, the severity of the disease, confidence in the treatment, and affordability. Conclusion: Clinical malaria incidence remains highest in the Lakeshore (24.3cases/1000 people/month) despite high LLINs coverage (90%). The travel distance to the health facility, severity of disease and affordability were mainly associated with 80% of residents either self-medicating or doing nothing to alleviate their illness.

Despite thorough research in the medical field, the pervasiveness of this deadly disease is increasing globally. More than 1.5 billion cases have been averted in the last two decades, with 7.6 million deaths. The traditional microscopic method of detecting whether a person is infected or not is time-consuming. Its accuracy depends on smear quality and individual expertise in counting and classifying parasitized and uninfected cells. Computer-aided diagnostic methods based on image processing and Machine learning (ML) use hand-generated features and need expertise in texture, morphological aspects, and analysis of a region of interest. Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based methods are superior to the traditional ML-based approach. They are highly scalable and give the best results with end-to-end feature extraction and classification. Hence, this research intends to design and develop a reliable framework for automatic malaria parasite detection using Deep learning (DL), which could serve as the best effective aid. This research paper evaluates the performance of pre-trained CNN-based DL models like AlexNet, ResNet50, and VGG19 as feature extractors for analyzing infected and non-infected cells. Statistical results show pre-trained CNN models serve as the best feature extractor tool for this purpose. Features extracted using VGG19 are proven to be more efficient than the ResNet50 and AlexNet to detect the presence of malaria parasites with a training accuracy of 95.28% and a testing accuracy of 93.89%.

In deprived settings, getting laboratory confirmation can be challenging and treatment may be based on a presumptive clinical diagnosis of malaria. However, the accuracy of clinical diagnosis is variable, and a universal predictive clinical algorithm is nonexistent. Objective: This study aimed to compare the use of clinical, microscopic and RDT methods in the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in four districts in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Methods: Patients initially seen and clinically diagnosed with malaria by a physician and referred for laboratory confirmation (microscopy and RDT) were recruited. Each patient provided a blood sample for malaria parasite detection. Microscopy was considered the diagnostic “gold standard”. The performance analysis included sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristics (ROC), kappa and Youden index. Results: In all 500 patients were recruited (33.2% males; mean age = 29.6 ± 20.3 years). Seventeen symptoms were reported — fever (84.4%), headache (64.2%) and chills (54.4%) were the highest. Hyperpyrexia (62.8%) and splenomegaly (38.8%) were the highest of the 6 vital signs recorded. Only Plasmodium falciparum parasites were identified by both microscopy and RDT. Prevalence values of 96.8%, 90.8%, and 43.0% were obtained for microscopy, RDT and clinical diagnosis, respectively (p < 0.05). Mean parasite density by microscopy was 16229.4 ± 10533.6 parasites/mL. Using microscopy as the gold standard, RDT reported a higher sensitivity (91.3%) compared to clinical diagnosis (43.6%), but a lower specificity (25.0% against 80.0%). Both RDT and clinical diagnosis had low negative predictive values, 8.7% and 4.2% respectively, against microscopy. There was poor consensus (kappa < 0.20) between all three diagnostic approaches.

The panel correctly classified 31 bacterial pathogens directly from positive blood culture bottles with a genus-level concordance of 96.7% and 90.3% on the Illumina and ONT platforms, respectively. Both sequencing platforms detected 18 viral and parasitic organisms directly from mock clinical samples of plasma and whole blood at concentrations of 104 PFU/mL with few exceptions. In general, Illumina sequencing exhibited greater read counts with lower percent mapped reads; however, this resulted in no effect on limits of detection compared with ONT sequencing. Mock clinical evaluation of the probe panel on the Illumina and ONT platforms resulted in positive predictive values of 0.91 and 0.88 and negative predictive values of 1 and 1 from de-identified human chikungunya virus samples compared with gold standard quantitative RT-PCR. Overall, these data show that molecular inversion probes are an adaptable technology capable of pathogen detection from complex sample matrices on current next-generation sequencing platforms. © 2022",,"Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA; U.S. Army",Comparison of Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Sequencing Technologies for Pathogen Detection from Clinical Matrices Using Molecular Inversion Probes,NO

The application of deep learning techniques for medical image classification has grown considerably in recent years. This research presents three implementations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs): ResNet50, VGG-16, and InceptionV3. These CNNs are applied to solve the classification problem of medical radiographs from people with pneumonia, as a manner to assist in the disease diagnosis. The three architectures used in this research obtained satisfactory results. The ResNet50 outperformed InceptionV3 and VGG-16, achieving the highest percentage of training and testing precision, as well as superior recall and f1-score. For the normal class, the f1-score related to ResNet50 was 88.42%, compared to 81.54% for InceptionV3 and 81.42% for VGG-16. For the pneumonia class, this metric was 95.10% against 92.82% for InceptionV3 and 92.54% for VGG-16.

Study population includes 303 eyes with an OSD and 55 normal eyes (controls). Observation procedures include spectral domain optical coherence tomography with epithelial mapping in the central 6 mm. Main outcome measures include ET map classification (normal, doughnut, spoke-wheel, localized/diffuse, and thinning/thickening patterns) and ET data and statistics (minimum, maximum, and SD). A quantitative threshold was determined with receiver operating curves to distinguish pathological from normal corneas. Sensitivity and specificity of classification and quantitative data were calculated using all eyes to assess the ability to distinguish corneas with a given corneal disorder from other conditions.Results:Classification of full agreement between 3 readers was obtained in 75.4% to 99.4% of cases. Main OSD features were keratoconus (135 eyes), doughnut pattern (sensitivity/specificity = 56/94%), and max-min ET ≥ 13 m (84/43%); limbal deficiency (56 eyes), spoke-wheel pattern (66/98%), and max-min ET ≥ 14 m (91/59%); epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (55 eyes), inferior thickening pattern (55/92%), and central ET > 56 m (53/81%); dry eye (21 eyes), superior thinning pattern (67/88%), and minimal ET ≤ 44 m (86/48%); pterygium (10 eyes), nasal thickening pattern (100/86%), and nasal ET > 56 m (80/71%); and in situ carcinoma (11 eyes), max ET > 60 m (91/60%), and ET SD >5 m (100/58%).Conclusions:The epithelial map pattern recognition combined with quantitative analysis of ET is relevant for the diagnosis of OSDs and for distinguishing various OSDs from each other.

The prevalence of infectious diseases is caused mainly by unlimited contact between people in a highly globalized world. Disease control and prevention (CDC) promptly collect and produce disease outbreak statistics, but CDCs rely on a curated, centralized collection system, and requires up to two weeks of lead time. Consequently, the quick release of disease outbreak information has become a great challenge. Infectious disease outbreak information is recorded and spread somewhere on the Internet much faster than CDC announcements, and Internet-sourced data have shown non-substitutable potential to watch and predict infectious disease outbreaks in advance. In this study, we performed a thorough analysis to show the similarity between the Korean Center of Disease Control (KCDC) infectious disease datasets and three Internet-sourced data for nine major infectious diseases in terms of time-series volume. The results show that many of infectious disease outbreak have strongly related to Internet-sourced data. We analyzed several factors that affect the similarity. Our analysis shows that the increase in the number of Internet-sourced data correlates with the increase in the number of infected people and thus, show the positive similarity. We also found that the greater the number of infectious disease outbreaks corresponds to having a wider spread of outbreak regions, in which it also proves to have higher similarity. We presented the prediction result of infectious disease outbreak using various Internet-sourced data and an effective deep learning algorithm. It showed that there are positive correlations between the number of infected people or the number of related web data and the prediction accuracy. We developed and currently operate a web-based system to show the similarity between KCDC and related Internet-sourced data for infectious diseases. This paper helps people to identify what kind of Internet-sourced data they need to use to predict and track a specific infectious disease outbreak. We considered as much as nine major diseases and three kinds of Internet-sourced data together, and we can say that our finding did not depend on specific infectious disease nor specific Internet-sourced data. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Forecasting; Infectious disease outbreak; Internet-sourced data; KCDC; Similarity; Web data,National Research Foundation of Korea Fund of NRF-2022R1F1A1063961,Deep similarity analysis and forecasting of actual outbreak of major infectious diseases using Internet-Sourced data,YES

Malaria is one of the most widespread diseases, with more than 200 million cases, according to the 2016 WHO report. Malaria is usually diagnosed using thin and thick blood smears under a microscope. However, proper diagnosis is difficult, especially in poor countries where the disease is most widespread. Therefore, automatic diagnostics helps in identifying the disease through images of red blood cells, with the use of machine learning techniques and digital image processing. This paper presents an accurate model using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network build from scratch. The paper also proposed three CNN models each one trained on the Malaria RBC dataset with different architectures for handling the classification tasks. Furthermore, disadvantage of the traditional method of using transfer learning, and how to control model complexity to achieve better performance was discussed. The dropout regularization technique was used to avoid overfitting problems and minimize validation loss. Applying Data Augmentation technique to avoid the problem of small data in training of proposed models, which is a very common problem in medical dataset. Finally, removing noise in Malaria images using a Median blur filter, and studying how effects of that on training CNN models.

Around 1 million new cases occur in the world annually, with a total of 12 million people affected, mainly in rural areas with low access to health services and adequate treatments. In the area of the Americas, Colombia has one of the highest infection rates after Brazil. Topical treatments with pentamidine isethionate (PMD) present an attractive alternative due to their ease of application and low costs. However, cutaneous leishmaniasis lesions present nodules with seropurulent exudate that, when drying, form hyperkeratotic lesions, hindering the effective penetration of drugs for their treatment. The use of molecular histology techniques, such as MALDI-MSI, allow in situ evaluation of the penetration of the treatment to the sections of the dermis where the disease-causing parasite resides. However, the large volume of information generated makes it impossible to process it manually. Machine learning techniques allow the unsupervised processing of large amounts of information, generating prediction models for the classification of new information. This work proposes a low-cost method to generate cutaneous leishmaniasis detection and classification models using MALDI-MSI images taken from murine models. The proposed models allow a 95% efficiency when separating healthy samples from infected samples and an effectiveness of 67% when separating effectively treated samples from unsuccessfully treated samples. © 2022 Springer New York LLC.

Thus, this issue necessitates the development of a new diagnostic schema. The objective of this work is to develop a diagnostic model for the earlier diagnosis of dengue disease using Efficient Machine Learning Techniques (EMLT). This paper proposed prediction models for dengue disease based on EMLT. Five different efficient machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC), Extra Tree Classifier (ETC), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). All classifiers are trained and tested on the dataset using 10-Fold Cross-Validation and Holdout Cross-Validation approaches. On a test set, all models were evaluated using different metrics: accuracy, F1-sore, Recall, Precision, AUC, and operating time. Based on the findings, the ETC model achieved the highest accuracy in Hold-out and 10-fold cross-validation, with 99.12 % and 99.03 %, respectively. In the Holdout cross-validation approach, we conclude that the best classifier with high accuracy is ETC, which achieved 99.12 %. Finally, the experimental results indicate that classifier performance in holdout cross-validation outperforms 10-fold cross-validation.

The statistical analysis of this study was performed by using the Chi-square and independent Student’s t tests. The diagnostic markers are considered statistically significant, if the serum ferritin level is higher than 500 ng/ml and the gall bladder wall thickness is more than 3 mm. The present study observed that, 39 patients (89%) who had severe dengue (n = 44) revealed a significant gall bladder wall thickening, and this correlation was significant statistically (p < 0.000). It was also observed that, the ferritin levels have a highly significant positive correlation with the severity of dengue.

Domperidone has recently been reported to improve kidney function in leishmaniotic dogs affected by CKD. Serum symmetric dimethylarginine (sSDMA) has also been shown to be a useful biomarker for earlier detection of decreased kidney function when compared to serum creatinine (sCr). This study aimed to assess the efficacy of domperidone plus renal diet in slowing the progression of nephropathy in leishmaniotic dogs with CKD, evaluating sSDMA and sCr as markers of kidney function. Methods: This study was a therapeutic, prospective, randomized, controlled, 11-month-long field trial. Dogs were recruited if classified as “exposed” to or “infected” with Leishmania infantum and affected by CKD at early stages. After enrolment (T0), dogs were randomized into groups T (treatment) and C (control). All dogs were fed a renal diet and then followed up at 90 (T1), 210 (T2), and 330 (T3) days after inclusion in the study. At T1 and T2, dogs in group T received an oral suspension of domperidone (1 ml/10 kg once a day for up to 28 days). Results: Twenty-two dogs (i.e., n = 12 in group T and n = 10 in group C) completed the study. At T0, the entire population of enrolled dogs presented a mean sSDMA value of 16.5 ± 3.4 μg/dl. At T1 (i.e., after 3 months of renal diet), sSDMA was significantly decreased in both groups, with an sSDMA of 13.1 ± 4.4 μg/dl for the entire population involved. From T1 to T3, sSDMA gradually increased in group C, while remaining stable in group T, which continued to show a significantly lower value of sSDMA at T3 than at T0. Regarding sCr, at T0 and T1, the mean values of the entire population of dogs were 1.1 ± 0.3 and 1.0 ± 0.4 mg/dl, respectively, with no statistical differences between groups T and C. In group T, sCr decreased significantly from T0 to T1, while returning at T3 to values similar to T0.

Existing malaria models are plagued with low rate of convergence, overfitting, limited generalization due to restriction to binary cases prediction, and proneness to local minimum errors in finding reliable testing output due to complexity of features in the feature space, which is a black box in nature. This study adopted a stacking method of heterogeneous ensemble learning of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to predict multiclass, symptomatic, and climatic malaria infection. ANN produced 48.33 percent accuracy, 60.61 percent sensitivity, and 45.58 percent specificity. SVM with Gaussian kernel function gave better performance results of 85.60 percent accuracy, 84.06 percent sensitivity, and 86.09 percent specificity. Consequently, to improve prediction performance, a stacking method was introduced to ensemble SVM with ANN.

Five deterministic and stochastic models, i.e. Seasonal Autoregressive Moving Average (SARIMA), Holt-Winters’ Exponential Smoothing, Harmonic Model, Seasonal and Trend Decomposition using Loess (STL) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), were fitted to the malaria incidence data. The study employed Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) to measure the accuracy of each model. The results indicated that the artificial neural network (ANN) model outperformed other models in terms of the lowest values of RMSE (39.4044), MAE (29.1615), MAPE (31.3611) and MASE (0.6618).

Three models (i.e., random forest (RF), long-short term memory (LSTM), and LSTM with attention mechanism (LSTM-ATT)), and two modeling scenarios (i.e., modeling with or without dengue cases) were set to implement 1- to 4-week ahead predictions. A total of 24 models were built, and the results showed in general that LSTM and LSTM-ATT models outperformed RF models; modeling could benefit from using historical dengue cases as one of the predictors, and it makes the predicted curve fluctuation more stable compared with that only using climate and environmental factors; attention mechanism could further improve the performance of LSTM models. This study provides implications for future dengue risk prediction in terms of the effectiveness of GEE-based big geospatial data processing for risk predictor generation and Google Colab-based risk modeling and presents the benefits of using historical dengue data as one of the input features and the attention mechanism for LSTM modeling. © 2022 by the author.",big geospatial data; cloud deep learning; dengue risk prediction; Google Colab; Google Earth Engine,"UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (104785); Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, (QYZDB-SSW-DQC005); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDA19040301); Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Science, IGSNRR, CAS, (E0V00110YZ)","Forecasting Weekly Dengue Cases by Integrating Google Earth Engine-Based Risk Predictor Generation and Google Colab-Based Deep Learning Modeling in Fortaleza and the Federal District, Brazil",YES

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax genomes is providing insights into parasite genetic diversity, transmission patterns, and can inform decision making for clinical and surveillance purposes. Advances in sequencing technologies are helping to generate timely and big genomic datasets, with the prospect of applying Artificial Intelligence analytical techniques (e.g., machine learning) to support programmatic malaria control and elimination. Here, we assess the potential of applying deep learning convolutional neural network approaches to predict the geographic origin of infections (continents, countries, GPS locations) using WGS data of P. falciparum (n = 5957; 27 countries) and P. vivax (n = 659; 13 countries) isolates. Using identified high-quality genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (P. falciparum: 750 k, P. vivax: 588 k), an analysis of population structure and ancestry revealed clustering at the country-level. When predicting locations for both species, classification (compared to regression) methods had the lowest distance errors, and > 90% accuracy at a country level. Our work demonstrates the utility of machine learning approaches for geo-classification of malaria parasites. With timelier WGS data generation across more malaria-affected regions, the performance of machine learning approaches for geo-classification will improve, thereby supporting disease control activities. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"BloomsburySET and Medical Research Council; Medical Research Council, MRC, (MR/M01360X/1, MR/N010469/1, MR/R020973/1, MR/R025576/1, MR/X005895/1)",Geographical classification of malaria parasites through applying machine learning to whole genome sequence data,YES

The iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin is highly upregulated during malaria and controls the availability of iron, a critical nutrient for bacterial growth. We investigated the relationship between Plasmodium falciparum malaria and NTS bacteremia in all pediatric admissions aged <5 years between August 1998 and October 2019 (n=75,034). We then assayed hepcidin and measures of iron status in five groups: (1) children with concomitant severe malarial anemia (SMA) and NTS (SMA+NTS, n=16); and in matched children with (2) SMA (n=33); (3) NTS (n=33); (4) cerebral malaria (CM, n=34); and (5) community-based children. SMA and severe anemia without malaria were associated with a 2-fold or more increased risk of NTS bacteremia, while other malaria phenotypes were not associated with increased NTS risk. Children with SMA had lower hepcidin/ferritin ratios (0.10; interquartile range [IQR]: 0.03-0.19) than those with CM (0.24; IQR: 0.14-0.69; P=0.006) or asymptomatic malaria (0.19; IQR: 0.09-0.46; P=0.01) indicating suppressed hepcidin levels. Children with SMA+NTS had lower hepcidin levels (9.3 ng/mL; IQR: 4.7-49.8) and hepcidin/ferritin ratios (0.03; IQR: 0.01-0.22) than those with NTS alone (105.8 ng/mL; IQR: 17.3-233.3; P=0.02 and 0.31; IQR: 0.06-0.66; P=0.007, respectively). Since hepcidin degrades ferroportin on the Salmonella-containing vacuole, we hypothesize that reduced hepcidin in children with SMA might contribute to NTS growth by modulating iron availability for bacterial growth. Further studies are needed to understand how the hepcidin-ferroportin axis might mediate susceptibility to NTS in severely anemic children. © 2022 Ferrata Storti Foundation",,"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Program, (203077, DEL-15-003); Wellcome Trust, WT, (110255, 202800, 212600); Wellcome Trust, WT; Government of the United Kingdom; New Partnership for Africa's Development, NEPAD; African Academy of Sciences, AAS",Hepcidin regulation in Kenyan children with severe malaria and non-typhoidal Salmonella bacteremia,NO

High-affinity antibodies are need for diagnosis and treatment of CHIKV infections. As a potential diagnostic and therapeutic agent, the multivalent VHH antibodies is a promising tookit in nanomedicine. Here, we developed potent multivalent VHH antibodies from an alpaca naïve phage display library targeting the E2 glycoprotein of the CHIKV virus. Results: In the present study, we generated 20 VHH antibodies using a naïve phage display library for binders to the CHIKV E2 glycoprotein. Of these, multivalent VHH antibodies Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 had specific high-affinity binding to E2 protein within the nanomolar range. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was between 2.59–20.7 nM, which was 100-fold stronger than the monovalent antibodies’ affinity. Moreover, epitope mapping showed that Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 recognized different linear epitopes located on the E2 glycoprotein domain C and A, respectively. A facile protocol of sandwich ELISA was established using BiNb-2E8 as a capture antibody and HRP-conjugated BiNb-3C5 as a detection antibody. A good linear correlation was achieved between the OD450 value and the E2 protein concentration in the 5–1000 ng/mL range (r = 0.9864, P < 0.0001), indicating its potential for quantitative detection of the E2 protein. Conclusions: Compared to monovalent antibodies, multivalent VHH antibodies Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 showed high affinity and are potential candidates for diagnostic applications to better detect CHIKV virions in sera.

WHO recommends reinforced antiretroviral prophylaxis for infants at high risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (MTCT) but its implementation needs further investigation in the field. Methods: The prospective ANRS 12344-DIAVINA study evaluated the feasibility of a strategy combining early infant diagnosis (EID) and reinforced antiretroviral prophylaxis in high-risk infants as identified by interviews with mothers at Ignace Deen Hospital, Conakry, Guinea. Results: 6493 women were admitted for delivery, 6141 (94.6%) accepted HIV testing and 114 (1.9%) were HIV positive. Among these, 51 high-risk women and their 56 infants were included. At birth, a blood sample was collected for infant EID and reinforced antiretroviral prophylaxis was initiated in 48/56 infants (86%, 95% CI 77%-95%). Iron supplementation was given to 35% of infants for non-severe anaemia. Retrospective measurement of maternal plasma viral load (pVL) at delivery revealed that 52% of women had pVL < 400 copies/mL attributable to undisclosed HIV status and/or antiretroviral intake. Undisclosed HIV status was associated with self-stigmatization (85% versus 44%, P = 0.02). Based on the results of maternal pVL at delivery, 'real' high-risk infants were more frequently lost to follow-up (44% versus 8%, P < 0.01) in comparison with low-risk infants, and this was associated with mothers' stigmatization (69% versus 31%, P < 0.01). Conclusions: Reinforced antiretroviral prophylaxis and EID at birth are widely feasible. However, mothers' self-disclosure of HIV status and antiretroviral intake do not allow adequate evaluation of MTCT risk, which argues for maternal pVL measurement near delivery. Furthermore, actions against stigmatization are crucial to improve PMTCT. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, they still suffer from the challenges of handling real-world scenarios especially reliably detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples. We propose an approach to robustly classify OoD samples in skin and malaria images without the need to access labeled OoD samples during training. Specifically, we use metric learning along with logistic regression to force the deep networks to learn much rich class representative features. To guide the learning process against the OoD examples, we generate in distribution's similar-looking examples by either removing class-specific salient regions in the image or permuting image parts and distancing them away from in-distribution (ID) samples. During inference time, the K-reciprocal nearest neighbor is employed to detect out-of-distribution samples. For skin cancer OoD detection, we employ two standard benchmark skin cancer ISIC datasets as ID, and six different datasets with varying difficulty levels were taken as out of distribution. For malaria OoD detection, we use the BBBC041 malaria dataset as ID and five different challenging datasets as out of distribution.

The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the differences in IL-6 levels between several groups of patients with malaria and healthy control groups. The systematic review was registered at PROSPERO with a registration number: CRD42021290753. Systematic literature searches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus until November 7, 2021 to obtain studies that documented IL-6 levels in patients with malaria. The quality of the included studies was assessed using critical appraisal tools from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Differences in the mean IL-6 levels among patients with: (1) severe and non-severe malaria, (2) uncomplicated malaria and controls, (3) uncomplicated and asymptomatic malaria, (4) asymptomatic malaria and healthy controls, and (5) those that died or survived were estimated using a random-effects model. Forty-three of 1,969 studies were included in the systematic review. Results of the meta-analysis showed that patients with severe malaria had higher mean IL-6 levels than those with non-severe malaria [P = 0.04, weight mean difference (WMD) = 96.63 pg/mL, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.88 − 19.38 pg/mL, I2 = 99.9%, 13 studies]. Patients with uncomplicated malaria had higher mean IL-6 levels than the controls (P < 0.001, WMD = 42.86 pg/mL, 95% CI = 30.17 − 55.56 pg/mL, I2 = 100%, 17 studies). No differences in the mean levels of IL-6 were found between patients with uncomplicated malaria and those with asymptomatic malaria (P = 0.063, WMD = 42.07 pg/mL, 95% CI = − 2.23 pg/mL to − 86.37 pg/mL, I2 = 99.1%, 8 studies), or between patients with asymptomatic malaria and healthy controls (P = 0.45, WMD = 1.67 pg/mL, 95% CI = − 2.73 pg/mL to − 6.07 pg/mL, I2 = 98.1%, 2 studies). A higher mean level of IL-6 was observed in patients who died compared with the levels of those who survived (P = 0.007, WMD = 1,399.19 pg/mL, 95% CI = 384.16 − 2,414.2 pg/mL, I2 = 93.1%, 4 studies). Our meta-analysis of the pooled evidence can be used to guide future studies in which IL-6 levels are measured during malaria outbreaks to monitor malaria severity. Heterogeneity of the effect estimate among the included studies was the main limitation of this analysis. In conclusion, significantly increased levels of IL-6 were observed in patients with severe malaria compared with those in patients with non-severe malaria, which indicates that IL-6 is a candidate marker for severe malaria. Future studies should investigate the sensitivity and specificity of increased IL-6 levels to determine the effectiveness of assessments of IL-6 levels monitoring of malaria infection and severity. © 2022, The Author(s).",,,Increased interleukin-6 levels associated with malaria infection and disease severity: a systematic review and meta-analysis,NO

This study investigates the association between hydroclimatic variability and DI (2008-2018) in a large tropical dryland area. The area studied comprehends seven municipalities with populations ranging from 32,879 to 2,545,419 inhabitants. First, the precipitation and temperature impacts on interannual and seasonal DI were investigated. Then, the monthly association between DI and hydroclimatic variables was analyzed using generalized least squares (GLS) regression. The model's capability to reproduce DI given the current hydroclimatic conditions and DI seasonality over the entire time period studied were assessed. No association between the interannual variation of precipitation and DI was found. However, seasonal variation of DI was shaped by precipitation and temperature. February-July was the main dengue season period. A precipitation threshold, usually above 100 mm, triggers the rapid DI rising. Precipitation and minimum air temperature were the main explanatory variables. A two-month-lagged predictor was relevant for modeling, occurring in all regressions, followed by a non-lagged predictor. The climate predictors differed among the regression models, revealing the high spatial DI variability driven by hydroclimatic variability. GLS regressions were able to reproduce the beginning, development, and end of the dengue season, although we found underestimation of DI peaks and overestimation of low DI. These model limitations are not an issue for climate change impact assessment on DI at the municipality scale since historical DI seasonality was well simulated. However, they may not allow seasonal DI forecasting for some municipalities. These findings may help not only public health policies in the studied municipalities but also have the potential to be reproducible for other dryland regions with similar data availability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Climate; Climate-sensitive diseases; Infectious diseases; Time series analysis,"CAPES Foundation/Brazilian Ministry of Education, (216/2018); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (18/2021, 402514/2021-1); Fundação Cearense de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, FUNCAP",Influence of hydroclimatic variability on dengue incidence in a tropical dryland area,NO

Concerns that increasing SP resistance in some areas of SSA may have compromised IPTp-SP efficacy prompted this contemporaneous study, designed to assess the prevalence and risk factors of sub-microscopic infection in parturient women during the low transmission season in Mutengene, a rapidly growing semi-urban area in Southwest Region, Cameroon. Pregnant women originally reporting for the establishment of antenatal clinic care during the dry season were followed-up to term and their pregnancy outcomes recorded. About 2 ml of venous blood was collected for malaria diagnosis using PfHRP2/ pLDH malaria rapid diagnostic kit and light microscopy. DNA was extracted from dried blood spots by the Chelex-100 method and the Plasmodium falciparum status detected by nested PCR amplification of the 18SrRNA gene using specific predesigned primers. Of the 300 women enrolled, the proportion of malaria parasite infected as determined by microscopy, RDT and PCR was 12.9%, 16.4% and 29.4% respectively, with 39.9% overall infected with P. falciparum by microscopy and/or RDT and/or PCR and a very low-density infection, averaging 271 parasites per microliter of blood. About 25.0% (68/272) of women who were negative by microscopy were positive by PCR (submicroscopic P. falciparum infection), with primigravidae and IPTp-SP non usage identified as independent risk factors for submicroscopic P. falciparum parasitaemia while fever history (aOR = 4.83, 95% CI = 1.28-18.22, p = 0.020) was associated with risk of malaria parasite infection overall. IPTp-SP use (p = 0.007) and dosage (p = 0.005) significantly influenced whether or not the participant will be malaria parasite negative or carry submicroscopic or microscopic infection. Although Infant birthweight and APGAR score were independent of the mother's P. falciparum infection and submicroscopic status, infant's birthweight varied with the gravidity status (p = 0.001) of the mother, with significantly lower birthweight neonates born to primigravidae compared to secundigravidae (p = 0.001) and multigravidae (p = 0.003). Even in holo-endemic dry season, there exists a large proportion of pregnant women with very low density parasitaemia. IPTp-SP seems to be relevant in controlling submicroscopic P. falciparum infections, which remains common in pregnant women, and are hard to diagnose, with potentially deleterious consequences for maternal and fetal health.

Collaboration on region-wide infectious disease surveillance systems is therefore critical but difficult to achieve because of the different transparency levels of health information systems in different countries. Although the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED)–mail is the most comprehensive international expert–curated platform providing rich disease outbreak information on humans, animals, and plants, the unstructured text content of the reports makes analysis for further application difficult. Objective: To make monitoring the epidemic situation in Southeast Asia more efficient, this study aims to develop an automatic summary of the alert articles from ProMED-mail, a huge textual data source. In this paper, we proposed a text summarization method that uses natural language processing technology to automatically extract important sentences from alert articles in ProMED-mail emails to generate summaries. Using our method, we can quickly capture crucial information to help make important decisions regarding epidemic surveillance. Methods: Our data, which span a period from 1994 to 2019, come from the ProMED-mail website. We analyzed the collected data to establish a unique Taiwan dengue corpus that was validated with professionals’ annotations to achieve almost perfect agreement (Cohen κ=90%). To generate a ProMED-mail summary, we developed a dual-channel bidirectional long short-term memory with attention mechanism with infused latent syntactic features to identify key sentences from the alerting article. Results: Our method is superior to many well-known machine learning and neural network approaches in identifying important sentences, achieving a macroaverage F1 score of 93%. Moreover, it can successfully extract the relevant correct information on dengue fever from a ProMED-mail alerting article, which can help researchers or general users to quickly understand the essence of the alerting article at first glance. In addition to verifying the model, we also recruited 3 professional experts and 2 students from related fields to participate in a satisfaction survey on the generated summaries, and the results show that 84% (63/75) of the summaries received high satisfaction ratings. Conclusions: The proposed approach successfully fuses latent syntactic features into a deep neural network to analyze the syntactic, semantic, and contextual information in the text. It then exploits the derived information to identify crucial sentences in the ProMED-mail alerting article. The experiment results show that the proposed method is not only effective but also outperforms the compared methods. Our approach also demonstrates the potential for case summary generation from ProMED-mail alerting articles. In terms of practical application, when a new alerting article arrives, our method can quickly identify the relevant case information, which is the most critical part, to use as a reference or for further analysis. © Yung-Chun Chang, Yu-Wen Chiu, Ting-Wu Chuang.",bidirectional long short-term memory; dengue; dual channel; natural language processing; ProMED-mail,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (108-2638-H-002-002-MY2, MOST 109-2410-H-038-012-MY2)",Linguistic Pattern–Infused Dual-Channel Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory With Attention for Dengue Case Summary Generation From the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases–Mail Database: Algorithm Development Study,YES

The implementation of ML algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machine, Naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, K-nearest neighbor, artificial neural network, convolutional neural network, and ensemble techniques to automate the process of infectious disease diagnosis is investigated in this study. We examined a number of ML models for tuberculosis (TB), influenza, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), dengue fever, COVID-19, cystitis, and nonspecific urethritis. Existing models have constraints in data handling concerns such data types, amount, quality, temporality, and availability. Based on the research, ensemble approaches, rather than a typical ML classifier, can be used to improve the overall performance of diagnosis. We highlight the need of having enough diverse data in the database to create a model or representation that closely mimics reality. © 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Microscopy remains the gold standard hallmark for diagnosis and estimation of parasitemia for malaria, to date. However, this approach is time-consuming and requires much expertise especially in malaria-endemic countries or in areas with low-density malaria infection. Thus, there is a need for accurate malaria diagnosis/parasitemia estimation with standardized, fast, and more reliable methods. To this end, we performed a proof-of-concept study using the automated imaging (NanoZoomer) platform to detect the malarial parasite in infected blood. The approach can be used as a steppingstone for malaria diagnosis and parasitemia estimation. Additionally, we created an algorithm (ParasiteMacro) compatible with free online imaging software (ImageJ) that can be used with low magnification objectives (e.g., 5×, 10×, and 20×) both in the NanoZoomer and routine microscope. The novel approach to estimate malarial parasitemia based on modern technologies compared to manual light microscopy demonstrated 100% sensitivity, 87% specificity, a 100% negative predictive value (NPV) and a 93% positive predictive value (PPV). The manual and automated malaria counts showed a good Pearson correlation for low- (R2 = 0.9377, r = 0.9683 and p < 0.0001) as well as high- parasitemia (R2 = 0.8170, r = 0.9044 and p < 0.0001) with low estimation errors.

This pandemic disease's fast and precise identification is essential for effective treatment. The most reliable method for diagnosing malaria is a microscopic examination of a thick and thin blood smear, which looks for the parasite and counts the number of infected cells. The ability to wholly or partially automate the identification of the disease using the information in medical images highlights the critical role that computer-aided diagnosis plays in modern medicine, in which machine learning and deep learning play a critical role. In this study, we have presented an in-depth overview of the techniques and methods used to diagnose the malaria parasite through blood slides automatically. One of the techniques is using transfer learning models to detect the malaria parasite. We have compared the performance of transfer learning models on identifying infected malaria cells by feeding the models a large dataset of uninfected and parasite cell images. The results show that the DensNet models have the edge over the other models, with DenseNet-201 achieving the highest accuracy and F1 score of 0.9339 and 0.9321, respectively. Also, DenseNet-169 outperformed the other models with 0.9594 in precision, and finally, Densenet-121 had the highest recall with 0.9490. © University of Garmian.

With the inherent instability of 5- hydroxyprimaquine, a stable surrogate, 5,6-orthoquinone, can now be detected and measured in the urine as part of primaquine pharmacokinetic studies. This study performed CYP450 2D6 genotyping and primaquine pharmacokinetic testing, to include urine 5,6-orthoquinone, in 27 healthy adult Cambodians, as a preliminary step to prepare for future clinical studies assessing primaquine efficacy for Plasmodium vivax infections. The CYP2D6*10 reduced activity allele was found in 57% of volunteers, and the CYP2D6 genotypes were dominated by*1/*10 (33%) and*10/*10 (30%). Predicted phenotypes were evenly split between Normal Metabolizer (NM) and Intermediate Metabolizer (IM) except for one volunteer with a gene duplication and unclear phenotype, classifying as either IM or NM. Median plasma primaquine (PQ) area under the curve (AUC) was lower in the NM group (460 h*ng/mL) compared to the IM group (561 h*ng/mL), although not statistically significant. Similar to what has been found in the US study, no 5,6-orthoquinone was detected in the plasma. The urine creatinine-corrected 5,6-orthoquinone AUC in the NM group was almost three times higher than in the IM group, with peak measurements (Tmax) at 4 h.

In this study, 100 patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma with local recurrence and distant metastasis who underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy were collected as the research subjects, and all underwent MRI multisequence imaging scans. At the same time, according to the evaluation criteria of solid tumor efficacy, patients with complete remission were classified into the effective group, and patients with partial remission, progressive disease, and stable disease were classified into the ineffective group. In addition, an image segmentation algorithm based on Balloon Snake model was proposed for MRI image processing, and simulation experiments were carried out. The results showed that the Dice coefficient of the proposed model segmentation of the reconstructed image was significantly higher than that of the level set model and the greedy algorithm, while the running time was the opposite (P<0.05). The lesion volume (38.76±5.34 cm3) in the effective group after treatment was significantly smaller than that in the noneffective group (46.33±4.64 cm3), and the rate of lesion volume shrinkage (28.71%) was significantly larger than that in the noneffective group (12.49%) (P<0.05). The relative apparent diffusion coefficient (rADC) value and rADC value change rate of the lesion after treatment in the effective group were significantly greater than those in the noneffective group (P<0.05). In summary, the image segmentation and reconstruction algorithm based on Balloon Snake model can not only improve the quality of MRI images but also shorten the processing time and improve the diagnostic efficiency. The volume regression rate and rADC value change rate of cervical squamous cell carcinoma lesion can reflect the early efficacy of concurrent chemoradiotherapy for cervical squamous cell carcinoma and have predictive value.  © 2022 Youyi Wu et al.",,,MRI Using Artificial Intelligence Algorithm to Evaluate Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Local Recurrence and Distant Metastasis of Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma,NO

So far NfL has not been assessed in cerebral malaria in human or its rodent model experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), a disease that can lead to fatal brain edema or reversible brain edema. In this study we assessed if NfL serum levels can also grade disease severity in an ECM mouse model with reversible (n = 11) and irreversible edema (n = 10). Blood–brain-barrier disruption and brain volume were determined by magnetic resonance imaging. Neurofilament density volume as well as structural integrity were examined by electron microscopy in regions of most severe brain damage (olfactory bulb (OB), cortex and brainstem). NfL plasma levels in mice with irreversible edema (317.0 ± 45.01 pg/ml) or reversible edema (528.3 ± 125.4 pg/ml) were significantly increased compared to controls (103.4 ± 25.78 pg/ml) by three to five fold, but did not differ significantly in mice with reversible or irreversible edema. In both reversible and irreversible edema, the brain region most affected was the OB with highest level of blood–brain-barrier disruption and most pronounced decrease in neurofilament density volume, which correlated with NfL plasma levels (r = − 0.68, p = 0.045). In cortical and brainstem regions neurofilament density was only decreased in mice with irreversible edema and strongest in the brainstem. In reversible edema NfL plasma levels, MRI findings and neurofilament volume density normalized at 3 months’ follow-up. In conclusion, NfL plasma levels are elevated during ECM confirming brain damage. However, NfL plasma levels fail short on reliably indicating on the final outcomes in the acute disease stage that could be either fatal or reversible. Increased levels of plasma NfL during the acute disease stage are thus likely driven by the anatomical location of brain damage, the olfactory bulb, a region that serves as cerebral draining pathway into the nasal lymphatics. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"MMPU; Deutsches Zentrum für Infektionsforschung, DZIF; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Universität Heidelberg",Neurofilament light chain plasma levels are associated with area of brain damage in experimental cerebral malaria,NO

Twenty peptides previously identified using a flavivirus proteome-wide microarray were evaluated to determine their discriminatory potential to detect dengue virus (DENV) infection. This included nine peptides recognized by IgM antibodies (PM peptides) and 11 peptides recognized by IgG antibodies (PG peptides). A bead-based multiplex peptide immunoassay (MPIA) using the Luminex technology was set-up to determine Ab binding levels to each of these peptides in a panel of 323 carefully selected human serum samples. Sera are derived from individuals either infected with different viruses, namely, the four DENV serotypes, Zika virus (ZIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), West Nile virus (WNV) and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or receiving vaccination against YFV, tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Additionally, a set of healthy controls were included. We targeted a minimum specificity of 80% for all the analysis. The PG-9 peptide had the best sensitivity (73%) when testing DENV sera from acute patients (A-DENV; <8 days since symptom onset). With sera from convalescent DENV patients (C-DENV; >10 days since symptom onset) the FPG-1 peptide was the best seromarker with a sensitivity of 86%. When combining all A-DENV and C-DENV samples, peptides PM-22 and FPG-1 had the best-diagnostic performance with a sensitivity of 60 and 61.1%, and areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.7865 and 0.8131, respectively. A Random forest (RF) algorithm was used to select the best combination of peptides to classify DENV infection at a targeted specificity >80%. The best RF model for PM peptides that included A-DENV and C-DENV samples, reached a sensitivity of 72.3%, while for PG peptides, the best RF models for A-DENV only, C-DENV only and A-DENV + C-DENV reached a sensitivity of 88.9%, 89.1%, and 88.3%, respectively. In conclusion, the combination of multiple peptides constitutes a founding set of seromarkers for the discrimination of DENV infected individuals from other flavivirus infections.

External validation of RDT results from field surveys can confirm appropriate RDT performance. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between July and November 2017 enrolling participants of all ages in households from 15 villages in four border regions of Tanzania: Geita, Kigoma, Mtwara and Ruvuma. All participants had an RDT performed in the field and provided a blood sample for later laboratory multiplex antigen detection of HRP2. In assessing the continuous HRP2 levels in participant blood versus RDT result, dose–response logistic regression provided quantitative estimates for HRP2 limit of detection (LOD). Results: From the 15 study villages, 6941 persons were enrolled that had a RDT at time of enrollment and provided a DBS for later laboratory antigen detection. RDT positive prevalence for the HRP2 band by village ranged from 20.0 to 43.6%, but the magnitude of this prevalence did not have an effect on the estimated LOD of RDTs utilized in different villages. Overall, HRP2 single-target tests had a lower LOD at the 95% probability of positive RDT (4.3 ng/mL; 95% CI 3.4–5.4) when compared to pLDH/HRP2 dual target tests (5.4 ng/mL; 4.5–6.3), though this difference was not significant. With the exception of one village, all other 14 villages (93.3%) showed RDT LOD estimates at 90% probability of positive RDT between 0.5 and 12.0 ng/mL. Conclusions: Both HRP2-only and pLDH/HRP2 combo RDTs utilized in a 2017 Tanzania cross-sectional survey of border regions generally performed well, and reliably detected HRP2 antigen in the low ng/mL range. Though single target tests had lower levels of HRP2 detection, both tests were within similar ranges among the 15 villages. Comparison of quantitative HRP2 detection limits among study sites can help interpret RDT testing results when generating population prevalence estimates for malaria infection. © 2022, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.",Histidine-rich protein 2; Limit of detection Plasmodium falciparum; Malaria; Rapid diagnostic tests; Tanzania,"Genomics for Malaria Elimination; NEPAD Agency; African Academy of Sciences, AAS; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC; American Arachnological Society, AAS; Malaria Branch and Catherine Bakari; Tanzanian Ministry of Health; Government of the United Kingdom; New Partnership for Africa's Development, NEPAD; DELGEME, (107740/Z/15/Z); Wellcome Trust, WT, (107740)","Performance of antigen detection for HRP2-based malaria rapid diagnostic tests in community surveys: Tanzania, July–November 2017",NO

Vector-borne diseases are life-threatening risk for human; approximately 27,437 people have been infected (2016) every year by this giant killer in West Bengal of India. Temperature and rainfall, two important parameters, have directly influenced the vector-borne diseases. An association between vector-borne diseases and climatic conditions has been established by using geographically weighted regression (GWR) technique. GWR resulted overall r square value more than 0.523 in every case of diseases signifies that the climatic parameters (temperature and rainfall) and vector-borne diseases (Dengue, Malaria, Japanese Encephlities) are strongly correlated. The climatic parameters and positive cases of diseases were mapped out by using inverse distance weight (IDW) interpolation technique in this study. Artificial neural network (ANN) was performed to predict and forecast the climatic condition. The predicted findings have been validated by root mean square error (RMSE) (temperature: 0.301; rainfall: 0.380, i.e., acceptable). This study revealed an insight between climate variables and vector-borne cases in different districts of West Bengal to better understand the effects of climate variability on these diseases. A novel approach of this study is to forecast the spreading of vector-borne diseases for incoming day in West Bengal. After a critical analysis, temperature and rainfall were found to be potent factors for the development of vectors (Aedes Aegypti and Aedes albopictus), and based on this, the risk of vector-borne diseases has been predicted for upcoming years.

Efficient identification of communities with high infection burden could help target more intensive control efforts. We hypothesized that IgG seroprevalence in combination with geospatial layers, machine learning, and model-based geostatistics would be able to accurately predict future community-level ocular Ct infections detected by PCR. We used measurements from 40 communities in the hyper-endemic Amhara region of Ethiopia to assess this hypothesis. Median Ct infection prevalence among children 0–5 years old increased from 6% at enrollment, in the context of recent mass drug administration (MDA), to 29% by month 36, following three years without MDA. At baseline, correlation between seroprevalence and Ct infection was stronger among children 0–5 years old (ρ = 0.77) than children 6–9 years old (ρ = 0.48), and stronger than the correlation between active trachoma and Ct infection (0-5y ρ = 0.56; 6-9y ρ = 0.40).

Adults with malaria suffered from Plasmodium vivax (N 5 70, median 2,823 [IQR 598–7,698] parasites/mL) or P. falciparum (N 5 24, median 1,148 [IQR 480–3,128] parasites/ mL). At baseline, adults with malaria more frequently had $ 3 B-lines (summed across eight zones) compared with controls (30% versus 2%, P value, 0.001), indicating higher lung density. When examinations were repeated, only 6% of adults with malaria had $ 3 B-lines at follow-up, which was significant lower compared with baseline (median reduction 3 B-lines; P value, 0.001). B-lines were not significantly associated with left ventricular ejection fraction in adults with malaria. In conclusion, B-lines detected by LUS were more frequent in adults with uncomplicated malaria compared with controls and decreased after completed antimalarial treatment.

The proposed modelling involves the data collection, preprocessing of the input texts, and feature extraction. The extracted features are studied to test how well the feature extraction using RF is effective on dengue datasets. The simulation result shows that the proposed method achieves higher degree of accuracy that offers an improvement of more than 12% than the existing methods in extracting the features from the input datasets than the other feature extraction methods. Further, the study reduces the errors associated with feature extraction that is 10% lesser than the other existing methods, and this shows the efficacy of the model.  © 2022 Jackson Daniel et al.",,,Recurrent Neural Networks for Feature Extraction from Dengue Fever,YES

This study aims to determine whether GPC3 alters the viscoelastic properties of HCC and whether tomoelastography, a multifrequency magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) technique, is sensitive to it. Methods: Ninety-five participants (mean age, 58 ± 1 years; 78 men and 17 women) with 100 pathologically confirmed HCC lesions were enrolled in this prospective study from July 2020 to August 2021. All patients underwent preoperative multiparametric MRI and tomoelastography. Tomoelastography provided shear wave speed (c, m/s) representing tissue stiffness and loss angle (φ, rad) relating to viscosity. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging parameters were compared between GPC3-positive and -negative groups. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were performed to determine factors associated with GPC3-positive HCC. The diagnostic performance of combined biomarkers was established using logistic regression analysis. Area-under-the-curve (AUC) analysis was done to assess diagnostic performance in detecting GPC3-positive HCC. Findings: GPC3-positive HCCs (n=72) had reduced stiffness compared with GPC3-negative HCCs (n=23) while viscosity was not different (c: 2.34 ± 0.62 versus 2.72 ± 0.62 m/s, P=0.010, φ: 1.11 ± 0.21 vs 1.18 ± 0.27 rad, P=0.21). Logistic regression showed c and elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level above 20 ng/mL were independent factors for GPC3-positive HCC. Stiffness with a cutoff of c = 2.8 m/s in conjunction with an elevated AFP yielded a sensitivity of 80.3%, specificity of 70.8%, and AUC of 0.80. Interpretation: Reduced stiffness quantified by tomoelastography may be a mechanical signature of GPC3-positive HCC. Combining reduced tumor stiffness and elevated AFP level may provide potentially valuable biomarker for GPC3-targeted immunotherapy.

The present study investigated consumption patterns of iron- and ascorbate-rich foods on iron status among WCA in Kapsabet Ward, Kenya. The study adopted a cross-sectional analytical design. A sample of 160 respondents was systematically selected proportionately in the eight villages. Consumption patterns of iron- and ascorbate-rich foods were assessed using a modified 7-d Food Frequency Questionnaire. Venous blood (2 ml) was drawn from participants. Serum ferritin and C-reactive proteins were measured by enzyme immunoassay. Consumption patterns of iron- and ascorbate-rich foods were analysed using descriptive statistics. Multivariable regression was conducted to investigate the association between iron- and ascorbate-rich foods consumption and iron status. Confounding variables such as consumption of foods high phytate levels, milk and milk products, recent major blood losses and parasitic infections were controlled for during analysis. The prevalence of iron deficiency among the WCA was 45·0 %.

Climate and demographic changes, the disorderly growth of cities and international trade have brought new arboviruses such as chikungunya and Zika. Control of arboviruses depends on control of the vector: the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Objective: In this work, we propose a methodology for building disease predictors capable of predicting infected cases and locations based on machine learning. We also propose an artificial experts committee based on meta-heuristic methods to detect the most relevant risk factors. Method As a case study, we applied the methodology to forecast dengue, chikungunya and Zika, with data from the City of Recife, Brazil, from 2013 to 2016. We used arboviruses cases data and climatic and environmental information: wind speeds, temperatures and precipitation. Results The best prediction results were obtained with 10-tree Random Forest regression, with Pearson’s correlation above 0.99 and RMSE (%) below 6%. Additionally, the artificial experts committee was able to present the most relevant factors for predicting cases in each two-month period. Conclusion: The spatiotemporal prediction results showed the evolution of arboviruses, pointing out as major focuses on both regions richer in urban green areas and low-income neighborhood with irregular water supply. Determining the most relevant factors for prediction, as well as the spatial distribution of cases, can be useful for the planning and execution of public policies aimed at improving the health infrastructure and planning and controlling the vector. © 2022, Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Biomedica.",Arboviruses; Artificial expert committees based on meta-heuristics; Chikungunya fever; Dengue fever; Machine learning forecasting; Spatiotemporal forecasting; Zika,"UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (NE/T013664/1); University College London, UCL; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Fundação de Amparo à Ciência e Tecnologia do Estado de Pernambuco, FACEPE; Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, UFPE","Spatiotemporal forecasting for dengue, chikungunya fever and Zika using machine learning and artificial expert committees based on meta-heuristics",YES

Considered for a long while a public health issue only in developing countries, the HEV infection is now a global public health concern. Most human infections are caused by the HEV genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 (HEV-1 to HEV-4). Although HEV-3 and HEV-4 can evolve to chronicity in immunocompromised patients, HEV-1 and HEV-2 lead to self-limited infections. HEV has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of ~7.2 kb that is translated into a large pORF1 replicative polyprotein, essential for the viral RNA genome replication and transcription. Unfortunately, the composition and structure of these replicases are still unknown. The recent release of the powerful machine-learning protein structure prediction software AlphaFold2 (AF2) allows us to accurately predict the structure of proteins and their complexes. Here, we used AF2 with the replicase encoded by the polyprotein pORF1 of the human-infecting HEV-3. The boundaries and structures reveal five domains or nonstructural proteins (nsPs): the methyltransferase, Zn-binding domain, macro, helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, reliably predicted. Their substrate-binding sites are similar to those observed experimentally for other related viral proteins. Precisely knowing enzyme boundaries and structures is highly valuable to recombinantly produce stable and active proteins and perform structural, functional and inhibition studies. © 2022 by the authors.",AlphaFold2; helicase; Hepatitis E virus; macro domain; nonstructural proteins; RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; viral replication/transcription enzymes,"National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01-GM129325); National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID; Aix-Marseille Université, AMU",Structure Prediction and Analysis of Hepatitis E Virus Non-Structural Proteins from the Replication and Transcription Machinery by AlphaFold2,YES

Previous studies suggest that stunted children have elevated inflammatory biomarkers, but no studies have characterised their capacity to respond to new infections (i.e., their immune function). We hypothesised that antibacterial immune function would differ between stunted and non-stunted children and relate to their health and environment during early life. Methods: We enrolled a cross-sectional cohort of 113 HIV-negative children nested within a longitudinal cluster-randomised controlled trial of household-level infant and young child feeding (IYCF) and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions in rural Zimbabwe (SHINE; Clinical trials registration: NCT01824940). Venous blood was collected at 18 months of age and cultured for 24 h without antigen or with bacterial antigens: heat-killed Salmonella typhimurium (HKST) or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). TNFα, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p70, hepcidin, soluble (s)CD163, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and IFNβ were quantified in culture supernatants by ELISA to determine antigen-specific immune function. The effect of stunting status and early-life exposures (anthropometry, inflammation at 18 months, maternal health during pregnancy, household WASH) on immune function was tested in logit and censored log-normal (tobit) regression models. Results: Children who were stunted (n = 44) had higher proportions (86.4% vs. 65.2%; 88.6% vs. 73.4%) and concentrations of LPS-specific IL-6 (geometric mean difference (95% CI): 3.46 pg/mL (1.09, 10.80), p = 0.035) and IL-8 (3.52 pg/mL (1.20, 10.38), p = 0.022) than non-stunted children (n = 69). Bacterial antigen-specific pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations were associated with biomarkers of child enteropathy at 18 months and biomarkers of systemic inflammation and enteropathy in their mothers during pregnancy. Children exposed to the WASH intervention (n = 33) produced higher LPS- (GMD (95% CI): 10.48 pg/mL (1.84, 60.31), p = 0.008) and HKST-specific MPO (5.10 pg/mL (1.77, 14.88), p = 0.003) than children in the no WASH group (n = 80). There was no difference in antigen-specific immune function between the IYCF (n = 55) and no IYCF groups (n = 58). Conclusions: Antibacterial immune function among 18-month-old children in a low-income setting was shaped by their stunting status and prior exposure to maternal inflammation and household WASH. Heterogeneity in immune function due to adverse exposures in early life could plausibly contribute to infection susceptibility.

The utility of RDTs can be limited by PfHRP2 persistence, however it can be a potential benefit in low transmission settings where detection of persistent PfHRP2 using newer ultra-sensitive PfHRP2 based RDTs can serve as a surveillance tool to identify recent exposure. Better understanding of the dynamics of PfHRP2 over the course of a malaria infection can inform optimal use of RDTs. Methods: A previously published mathematical model was refined to mimic the production and decay of PfHRP2 during a malaria infection. Data from 15 individuals from volunteer infection studies were used to update the original model and estimate key model parameters. The refined model was applied to a cohort of patients from Namibia who received treatment for clinical malaria infection for whom longitudinal PfHRP2 concentrations were measured. Results: The refinement of the PfHRP2 dynamic model indicated that in malaria naïve hosts, P. falciparum parasites of the 3D7 strain produce 33.6 × 10−15 g (95% CI 25.0–42.1 × 10−15 g) of PfHRP2 in vivo per parasite replication cycle, with an elimination half-life of 1.67 days (95% CI 1.11–3.40 days). The refined model included these updated parameters and incorporated individualized body fluid volume calculations, which improved predictive accuracy when compared to the original model. The performance of the model in predicting clearance of PfHRP2 post treatment in clinical samples from six adults with P. falciparum infection in Namibia improved when using a longer elimination half-life of 4.5 days, with 14% to 67% of observations for each individual within the predicted range. Conclusions: The updated mathematical model can predict the growth and clearance of PfHRP2 during the production and decay of a mono-infection with P. falciparum, increasing the understanding of PfHRP2 antigen dynamics. This model can guide the optimal use of PfHRP2-based RDTs for reliable diagnosis of P. falciparum infection and re-infection in endemic settings, but also for malaria surveillance and elimination programmes in low transmission areas. © 2022, The Author(s).",Antigen dynamics; Elimination and surveillance; Histidine rich protein; Plasmodium falciparum; Rapid diagnostic tests,"University of Namibia, UNAM; Wellcome Trust, WT, (095909); Guidance Programs of Science and Technology Funds of the Xiangyang city, (2020ZD32); National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC, (1135955, 1132975); Major Research Development Program of Hubei Province, (2020BBB092)",The in-vivo dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum HRP2: implications for the use of rapid diagnostic tests in malaria elimination,NO

The purpose of this study is to characterize unique metabolites in serum of cirrhotic EVB patients and identify potential noninvasive biomarkers for detecting and assessing risk of variceal bleeding and cirrhosis progression through metabolomics-based approaches and explore possible pathophysiological mechanisms. Methods: We used ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) to profile serum metabolomes. In one discovery cohort (n = 26, 13 cases of EVB), univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed to demonstrate separation between the two groups and identify differentially expressed metabolites. Potential biomarkers were screened by Boruta and logistic regression analyses, further evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analysis, and tested in two validation cohorts (n = 34, 17 cases and n = 10, 5 cases). Results: Bioinformatics analyses demonstrated that EVB patients possessed distinct metabolic phenotypes compared with nEVB controls, characterized by seven elevated and six downregulated metabolites, indicating that EVB-related metabolic disturbance might be associated with vitamin metabolism and fatty acid metabolism. Eight potential biomarkers were selected among which citrulline and alpha-aminobutyric acid with moderate AUC values, tested in the validation cohorts, were identified as specific biomarkers of EVB.

Data obtained from the survey were entered into Microsoft Excel 2010 and analysed with SPSS version 20.0. Data was summarized using descriptive statistics. Chi-square, bivariate and multivariable logistic regression and Pearson correlation test were used to measure associations between urogenital schistosomiasis, age, sex and haematuria. Odds ratio was used to measure strengths of association between variables. Agreement between urine filtration method and urinalysis reagent strip was determined using Kappa statistics. P-value < 0.05 at 95% CI was considered as statistically significant. Results Among the 1,171 urine samples from schoolchildren examined by urine filtration method, 143 (12.2%) were S.haematobium egg positive. Out of 143 positive children 126(88.1%) were lightly infected and 17 (11.9%) were heavily infected. Among the total of 1,171 urine samples tested by dipstick, 264(22.5%) were positive for haematuria. Prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis by both urine filtration and urinalysis reagent strip method was higher in Abobo than Hassoba (Amibara) and Kurmuk (P< 0.001). The number of egg counts (intensity of infections) were significantly correlated with intensity of haematuria (r = 0.6, P < 0.001). Egg-positive children had significantly higher risk of having haematuria compared to S. haematobium egg negative children (OR; 6.96; 95%CI: 4.98, 8.940). Compared to urine filtration method, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of urinalysis reagent strip were 99.3%, 88.1%, 53.8% and 99.8%, respectively. Furthermore, its positive likelihood ratio (PLR) and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) were 8.34 and 0.008, respectively. The accuracy index and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of reagent strip were 0.89 and 1054, respectively. The agreement level between urine filtration methods and urinalysis reagent strip for detecting urogenital schistosomiasis was substantial (Kappa = 0.64). Conclusion This study showed that urogenital schistosomiasis was prevalent in schoolchildren in Abobo, Hassoba and Kurmuk districts. Urogenital schistosomiasis prevalence in Hassoba-bure and Kurmuk falls under low category whereas moderate in Abobo and is almost four times compared to Kurmuk and Hassoba-bure. Chemotherapy is needed in schoolchildren in such endemic areas and other measures like access to safe water, improved sanitation, hygiene, and health education should be implemented to control and prevent schistosomiasis effectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of urinalysis reagent strip were higher and could serve as alternative for mass screening of urogenital schistosomiasis, for surveillance and evaluation of schistosomiasis intervention programs.

The identification of a biomarker that can predict, or rule out, its subsequent development can help identify at-risk individuals. Methods: 200 dengue patients were included–the first 100 in the deterministic cohort and the latter, the validation cohort. Serum ferritin levels were measured at first presentation. Platelets were monitored serially. Data from the first cohort was used to determine the optimal ferritin level to predict significant thrombocytopenia (<20,000/µL). This threshold was validated in the second cohort. Results: In the deterministic cohort, a ferritin threshold of 593 ng/mL predicted severe thrombocytopenia with a sensitivity of 93.33%, negative predictive value of 98.18% and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.10. In the validation cohort, the sensitivity and negative predictive value of this threshold were both 100%. The power of the study (determined post-hoc) for each cohort was 98.4% and 86.4% respectively. Conclusion: First-contact ferritin consistently identified at-risk individuals.

In this research, Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of Zika virus, are studied to examine neighborhood-level differences in their population dynamics and underlying processes. Weekly mosquito data were acquired from the Miami-Dade County Mosquito Control Division from 2016 to 2020 from 172 traps deployed around Miami-Dade County. Using random forest, a machine learning method, predictive models of spatiotemporal dynamics of Ae. aegypti in response to meteorological conditions and neighborhood-specific socio-demographic and physical characteristics, such as land-use and land-cover type and income level, were created. The study area was divided into two groups: areas affected by local transmission of Zika during the 2016 outbreak and unaffected areas. Ae. aegypti populations in areas affected by Zika were more strongly influenced by 14- and 21-day lagged weather conditions. In the unaffected areas, mosquito populations were more strongly influenced by land-use and day-of-collection weather conditions. There are neighborhood-scale differences in Ae. aegypti population dynamics. These differences in turn influence vector-borne disease diffusion in a region. These results have implications for vector control experts to lead neighborhood-specific vector control strategies and for epidemiologists to guide vector-borne disease risk preparations, especially for containing the spread of vector-borne disease in response to ongoing climate change.

The in-silico approach to T-cell epitope prediction of Zika virus is useful to save biologist's time and efforts for vaccine development. The authors have proposed a novel ensemble machine learning model to predict Zika virus T–cell epitopes using physicochemical properties of amino acids. The model has been designed by fusing the top two performing classifiers from among the six machine learning classifiers (base classifiers). The peptide sequences consisting of experimentally determined T-cell epitopes and non-epitopes of Zika virus were collected from Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB). The authors have verified the model through Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 92.11% on the test dataset. We validated the model using a separate validation set and the model achieved an accuracy of 93.47%, Gini of 0.968, AUC of 0.996, the sensitivity of 0.964, and specificity of 0.961. To check the robustness of the model, a technique called repeated k-fold cross-validation was used, and an average accuracy of 91.7% was recorded.

To combat malaria, effective diagnosis and treatment using artemisinin-based combinations are needed, as well as strategies that are aimed at reducing or stopping transmission by mosquito vectors. Even if the conventional microscopic diagnosis is the gold standard for malaria diagnosis, it is time consuming, and the diagnostic performance depends on techniques and human expertise. In addition, tools for characterizing Anopheles vectors are limited and difficult to establish in the field. The advent of computational biology, information technology infrastructures, and mobile computing power offers the opportunity to use artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to address challenges and technical needs specific to malaria-endemic countries. This chapter illustrates the trends, advances, and future challenges linked to the deployment of AI in malaria. Two innovative AI approaches are described. The first is the image-based automatic classification of malaria parasites and vectors, and the second is the proteomics analysis of vectors. The developed applications are aimed at facilitating malaria diagnosis by performing malaria parasite detection, species identification, and estimation of parasitaemia. In the future, they can lead to efficient and accurate diagnostic tools, revolutionizing the urgent diagnosis of malaria. Other applications focus on the characterization of mosquito vectors by performing species identification, behavior, and biology descriptions.

Machine learning mainly prioritizes the development and designing of software that can blow-up data and utilize it to train for themselves. The continual feature of machine learning is important because as applications are exposed to newly fed data, they are capable to independently adapt to the environment. They train from previously applied computations to produce reliability, repeatable decisions and results. Machine Learning in healthcare is a field, which uses advanced analytics on different types of data-structured & unstructured, to obtain insights and generate predictions aiding in improving the quality of healthcare drastically. One could imagine how practical it would be to predict a patient's risk for a disease or an organ malfunction in advance based on a record of their previous diagnostics, test results, ancestry, etc. The practicality of machine learning in healthcare lies in its ability to procure enormous datasets beyond the stretch of human's capability, and then genuinely convert those data with analytics into insightful results which then aids the healthcare sector to efficiently plan and provide supervision, eventually leading to greater outcomes-reduced costs of treatment, drug discoveries, and an satisfactory patient. In this proposed chapter we discuss the various applications of machine learning in the healthcare sector discussing various outstanding researches are followed in different types of analytics and integrated into clinical practices across the world by various healthcare organizations. The various applications of machine learning in the field of healthcare includes: Improving healthcare services of community clinics using machine learning techniques, smart neonatal healthcare system, malaria detection using convolutional neural networks based image analysis, diabetes detection using support vector machines, machine learning for developing personalized medicine for predicting myocardial infarction, techniques to compare performance of risk prediction models for forecasting postoperative sepsis and acute kidney injury, precision psychiatry for predicting mental illness, heart disease diagnostics using support vector machines, prediction of 30-day mortality among stroke victims in rural hospitals, advanced machine learning techniques for noninvasive monitoring of brain hemorrhage, etc. The above mentioned research focuses mostly on rural health care. This chapter also includes these topics also because of how the advancement in machine learning is effectively helping with the diagnosis in the rural sectors without the availability of expensive and modern machinery.

It is associated with malnutrition, the weak immune system of people, and their housing locality. It is diagnosed by microscopic identification, molecular and biochemical characterization, or serum analysis for parasitic compounds. In this study, we present a new approach for diagnosing leishmaniasis using transcriptome data and cognitive computing. The transcriptome data of leishmaniasis were collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and it was processed. The algorithm for training and developing a model based on the data was prepared and coded using python. The algorithm and their corresponding datasets were integrated using the TensorFlow data frame. A feedforward artificial neural network trained model with multilayer perceptron was developed as a diagnosing model for leishmaniasis, using transcriptome data. It was created using a recurrent neural network. The cognitive model of the trained network was interpreted using the maps and mathematical formula of the influencing parameters. The credit of the system was measured using the accuracy, loss, and error of the system. This integrated leishmaniasis transcriptome data and neural network system acted as an excellent diagnosis model with higher accuracy and lower error. The experimental results of feedforward multilayer perceptron model after normalization, mean square error (219.84), loss function (1.94), and accuracy (85.71%) of the model show the excellent fit of the model with the process, and it could be a better solution for diagnosing leishmaniasis in future, using transcriptome data.

The parasites in mosquitoes that are known to be the cause of this deadly disease belong to the Plasmodium genus. Reliable and accurate detection of the disease at an early stage thus becomes an important task at hand. This should be done so that proper medical treatments and healthcare can be provided to the patients for a full recovery. The manual methods using a microscope, involved in the detection of the parasite often lead to inaccurate and unreliable results as they depend on the skills of the pathologist as well as the conditions of the clinic and the facilities available. Hence, automation of the process is essential so that the errors in the manual methods can be rectified and meticulous results can be yielded. Our method involves cleaning up the blood smear images obtained from the laboratories, extracting the parasite features, and then training the preprocessed dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The CNN is a deep learning calculation that soaks up associations in data images, allots significance (learnable masses and inclinations) to different perspectives/protests within the image, and has the choice to separate one from the opposite.

Malaria is a disease caused due to plasmodium parasite. It requires a type of mosquito as its host. Hence, the bite of the mosquito leads to malaria. The impact it carries on the health of people around the world is extremely large and cannot be curtailed or controlled without quick and efficient diagnostics and treatment. Subsequent topics dwell on the constraints of detection of the malaria parasite. These constraints may include problems with the feasibility of certain types of tests, or not having access to a diagnostics center or problems with transportation of necessary infrastructure. We also must understand that traditional prognosis methods are very tedious and hence always have a chance for human error or oversight leading to devastating consequences. The ease or simplification of diagnosis of malaria upon the use of machine learning and deep learning is undeniable; hence, in our project, we aim to create a model, using CNN, which using feature extraction, can predict whether a sample image of a Red Blood Cell provided to the model is parasitized or unhealthy. This model has a primary goal of detecting malaria in Red Blood Cells from blood smears with the least number of losses. This allows for the most minimal number of malaria-infected cell to be mistakenly passed off as healthy cells.

The first step in fighting malaria is to have an accurate, fast, and trusted diagnosing method, which is a problem facing lab technicians worldwide. In Sudan, the burden of malaria is especially heavy because the healthcare system is weakly structured, the number of qualified personnel to conduct an accurate diagnosis is low, and the number of samples that can be tested per day is limited. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have the potential for addressing these problems by partially automating the process. This chapter describes the design, implementation, and testing of a machine learning model that detects one of the most widespread malaria parasites (Plasmodium falciparum) using samples of thin blood smears on standard microscope slides that were taken by local laboratories in Khartoum, Sudan. A watershed segmentation technique is used to acquire the erythrocytes from microscopic blood sample images, followed by a deep learning classifier. The classifier is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) obtained using transfer learning: first, a base CNN is trained using a large publicly available dataset of stained infected and uninfected cells; then, several layers are appended to the CNN, which is retrained using locally obtained cell images, with image augmentation. Results showed that although good performance is obtained on the public dataset with the base CNN, the retrained CNN performs poorly on local images. Two reasons for this are the small number of local images available for training, as well as the poor quality of local images. We conclude that these factors pose significant obstacles for the use of machine learning in biomedical applications in developing countries. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Blood; Cell images; Clinical diagnosis; Convolutional neural network; Dataset; Detection; Healthcare; Infections; Labs; Machine learning; Malaria; Microscopy; PCR; Plasmodium; Procedure; Regression; Techniques; Threshold; Transfer learning; Tropical,,Malaria Detection Using Machine Learning,YES

In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, called Proximity Time Ensemble, to predict DF outbreaks for multiple areas (provinces) and multiple time steps ahead, and to study the effects of climate data on DF outbreaks. PT-Ensem consists of 6 key components: (1) an event-to-event probabilistic framework to study links among extreme climate events and DF outbreaks; (2) a proximity graph that connects similar provinces; (3) an ensemble prediction technique that combines many different advanced machine learning (ML) methods to predict outbreaks within t time steps in the future using extreme climate events as model inputs; (4) a data aggregate scheme to enrich training data for each province via its neighbors in the proximity graph; (5) a proximity propagation step that propagates predicted results among similar provinces via the proximity graph until maximal agreements are reached among provinces; and (6) a time propagation step to propagate results via different predicted time steps in each province. We use PT-Ensem to predict DF outbreaks for all provinces in Vietnam using data collected from 1997-2016.

With the advancement of advanced technique including machine and deep learning mechanism, this solution can be enhanced to verify the severity of this diseases and make them to properly diagnose the infected case. In this context, an artificial intelligence based convolutional neural network model has been developed to categorize the blood cell into malaria infected and uninfected type of classes. Performance of the model has been evaluated using standard evaluation measures on the public dataset of malaria blood cell images. Obtained quantitative scores confirms its performance which outperforms the available state-of-the-art techniques. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Computer-added diagnosis; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Malaria parasite; Medical imaging; Red blood cell examination,,Malaria Detection from Blood Cell Images Using Convolutional Neural Network Model,YES
2022.0,diagnostics,"Electrical and Electronics Engineering, College of Electronics Technology, Tripoli, Libya","Malaria detection and classification is still time and money costly. Identification of malaria cells can be done through some costly techniques. Those techniques are good, but they require time and high cost. Hence, there is a need of discovering alternative techniques to identify blood cells, that saves both time and reduce cost. In addition to time and cost, those new techniques should also be accurate and effective. Thus, in this work, we propose a transfer learning based GoogleNet approach for the classification of Malaria cells. The depth and inception of GoogleNet made it a very robust deep network that can classify accurately if trained and fine-tuned on enough amount of data. Thus, in this study, 27558 of the 2 types of cells are used for fine-tuning and testing the pre-trained network GoogleNet. Experimentally, the employed GoogleNet fine-tuned to classify Malaria, showed a great capability in generalizing accurate and correct diagnosis of images that were not seen during training, in which it achieved a testing accuracy of 95% with a relatively short time and small number of epochs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Classification; Deep network; GoogleNet; Malaria; Transfer learning,,Malaria Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network,YES

Malaria is a major problem in tropical and subtropical countries. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a mechanism for early detection of the plasmodium parasite, which is infections. In the conventional method, which is used to diagnose malaria in the laboratory by capturing cells with a microscope, a series of tests are performed and the results are analyzed.

It is curable, but only with early detection and prompt, effective treatment. It may lead to severe conditions if it is not properly diagnosed and treated in its early stages. In the worst-case scenario, it can result in death. The preferred methods for diagnosing malaria are microscopic analysis of blood samples or rapid diagnostic tests. This method is time-consuming and requires qualified medical personnel, who are currently in short supply and quite expensive. Detecting malaria from blood smears using this method is therefore extremely difficult. As a result of the rapid development of deep learning, numerous experts have attempted to implement it in the medical sector due to its ability to overcome the limitations of conventional methods. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to design and develop a model for the detection of malaria parasites. Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and YOLOv5 algorithm to detect and classify malaria with the selected dataset, respectively, is the proposed method.

To meet the goals of AI, and to link the gap in AI, machine learning concepts have emerged. With the help of available data and experience, the ML algorithms are trained and employed to draw some hidden information and underlying patterns. Based on the dataset, and output, many ML algorithms are being used in recent research studies. The ML algorithms are separated into three broad categories such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning algorithms. These ML algorithms are being used to extract meaningful information and prediction parameters. Many ML algorithms have been applied and implemented on earlier disease prediction and analysis. Roughly of the unsupervised algorithms were also applied to maintain the integrity in preserving the medical related health care records (Rizwana et al. in Int J Recent Technol Eng 7(6): 579–582, 2019).

Early and correct diagnosis is vital to avoid health complexities, however, it depends upon the availability of costly microscopes and trained experts to analyze blood-smear slides. Deep learning-based methods have the potential to not only decrease the burden of experts but also improve diagnostic accuracy on low-cost microscopes. However, this is hampered by the absence of a reasonable size dataset. One of the most challenging aspects is the reluctance of the experts to annotate the dataset at low magnification on low-cost microscopes. We present a dataset to further the research on malaria microscopy over low-cost microscopes at low magnification. Our large-scale dataset consists of images of blood-smear slides from several malaria-infected patients, collected through micro-scopes at two different cost spectrums and multiple magnifications. Malarial cells are annotated for the localization and life-stage classification task on the images collected through the high-cost microscope at high magnification. We design a mechanism to transfer these annotations from the high-cost microscope at high magnification to the low-cost microscope, at multiple magnifications. Multiple object detectors and domain adaptation methods are presented as the baselines.

However, synthesizing medical images using CycleGAN can lead to misdiagnosis of a medical condition as it might hallucinate unwanted features, especially if theres a data bias. This can potentially change the original class of the input image, which is a very serious problem. In this paper, we have introduced a modified distribution matching loss for CycleGAN to eliminate feature hallucination on the malaria dataset. In the context of the malaria dataset, unintentional feature hallucination may introduce a facet that resembles a parasite or remove the parasite after the translation. Our proposed approach has enabled us to shift the domain of the malaria dataset without the risk of changing their corresponding class.We have presented experimental evidence that our modified loss significantly reduced feature hallucination by preserving original class labels.

Top muscle atrophy gene regulators are selected by Bayesian Markov blanket method and gene–disease knowledge graph is constructed using the scalable precision medicine knowledge engine. A deep graph neural network is trained for predicting links in the network. The top ranked diseases are identified and drugs are selected for repurposing using drug bank resource. A disease drug knowledge graph is constructed and the graph neural network is trained for predicting new drugs. The results are compared with machine learning methods such as random forest, and gradient boosting classifiers. Network measure based methods shows that preferential attachment has good performance for link prediction in both the gene–disease and disease–drug graphs. The receiver operating characteristic curves, and prediction accuracies for each method show that the random walk similarity measure and deep graph neural network outperforms the other methods.

Brazil is considered an endemic country for dengue, such that more than 1,544,987 confirmed cases were notified in 2019, which means an incidence rate of 735 for every 100 thousand inhabitants. Climate is an important factor in the temporal and spatial distribution of vector-borne diseases, such as dengue. Thus, rainfall and temperature are considered macro-factors determinants for dengue, since they directly influence the population density of Aedes aegypti, which is subject to seasonal fluctuations, mainly due to these variables. This study examined the incidence of dengue fever related to the climate influence by using temperature and rainfall variables data obtained from remote sensing via artificial satellites in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The mathematical model that best fits the data is based on an auto-regressive moving average with exogenous inputs (ARMAX). It reproduced the values of incidence rates in the study period and managed to predict with good precision in a one-year horizon. The approach described in present work may be replicated in cities around the world by the public health managers, to build auxiliary operational tools for control and prevention tasks of dengue, as well of other arbovirus diseases.

Methods: All data were obtained from malaria infected and non-infected Sudanese patients attending to Kosti Teaching Hospital. The effect of malaria on the hematological parameters was depicted. The relationships between hematological parameters with the effect of malaria in the two groups were assessed using Spearman's correlation. The quantitative effects of malaria on the hematological parameters were assessed using SPSS 21.0 software with a neutral network feature. Results: There was no correlation between the effect of malaria infection and MCV, PCV, and MCHC (r = 0.055, r = 0.087, and r = 0.067, respectively) among Sudanese population (p > 0.05). An obvious correlation was observed between hemoglobin concentration (Hb Conc.), RBC count, MCH, and ESR and the effect of malaria infection (r = -0.226, r = 0.285, r = 0.286, and r = -0.378, respectively (p < 0.05). The effect of malaria infection on PCV standardized percentage (100%) was much higher than other hematological parameters. Conclusions: Changes in the PCV measurements among Sudanese patients may be associated with the higher effect of malaria infection. Because malaria is caused by a blood parasite, early diagnosis and treatment could contribute to improve the individual health status. © 2021 Verlag Klinisches Labor GmbH.

The immunologic response in SBE could inform a prognostic model to predict recovery. The purpose of this study was to develop pre- and post-antivenom prognostic models comprised of clinical features and immunologic cytokine data that are associated with recovery from SBE. Materials and Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study in an academic medical center emergency department. We enrolled consecutive patients with Crotalinae SBE and obtained serum samples based on previously described criteria for the Surgical Critical Care Initiative (SC2i)(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02182180). We assessed a standard set of clinical variables and measured 35 unique cytokines using Luminex Cytokine 35-Plex Human Panel pre- and post-antivenom administration. The Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS), a well-validated patient-reported outcome of functional recovery, was assessed at 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days and the area under the patient curve (PSFS AUPC) determined. We performed Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) modeling to represent relationships with a diagram composed of nodes and arcs. Each node represents a cytokine or clinical feature and each arc represents a joint-probability distribution (JPD). Results: Twenty-eight SBE patients were enrolled. Preliminary results from 24 patients with clinical data, 9 patients with pre-antivenom and 11 patients with post-antivenom cytokine data are presented. The group was mostly female (82%) with a mean age of 38.1 (SD ± 9.8) years. In the pre-antivenom model, the variables most closely associated with the PSFS AUPC are predominantly clinical features. In the post-antivenom model, cytokines are more fully incorporated into the model. The variables most closely associated with the PSFS AUPC are age, antihistamines, white blood cell count (WBC), HGF, CCL5 and VEGF. The most influential variables are age, antihistamines and EGF. Both the pre- and post-antivenom models perform well with AUCs of 0.87 and 0.90 respectively. Discussion: Pre- and post-antivenom networks of cytokines and clinical features were associated with functional recovery measured by the PSFS AUPC over 28 days. With additional data, we can identify prognostic models using immunologic and clinical variables to predict recovery from SBE. © Copyright © 2021 Gerardo, Silvius, Schobel, Eppensteiner, McGowan, Elster, Kirk and Limkakeng.",antivenin; chemokine; cytokine; Patient Specific Functional Scale; predictive modeling; prognostic model; snake bite,"BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals; U.S. Department of Defense, DOD, (USUHS HT9494-13-1-0032)",Association of a Network of Immunologic Response and Clinical Features With the Functional Recovery From Crotalinae Snakebite Envenoming,NO

Malaria is a worldwide deadly disease caused by Plasmodium parasites. This research designs an effective VQC-based approach to recognize the existence of malaria from the Red blood cell (RBC) image through the classification of the optimized feature set that has been extracted from a set of RBC images. Minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR), and Principal component analysis (PCA), are used to optimize the feature set. Comparing to existing classical approaches we have found that mRMR with our input encoding and parameterized circuit of VQC shows satisfactory performance by using a lower number of features and a lower number of parameters. After ascertaining the presence of malaria from VQC we have also introduced a rule-based expert system to detect the types of malaria. The proposed mechanism is mainly designed to evaluate the potency of quantum machine learning (QML) in near-term quantum computers and using the ten-fold cross-validation the scheme gained an overall accuracy, precision, recall, and specificity of 99.06%, 99.08%, 99.05%, and 99.07% respectively for malaria disease diagnosis. © 2021 The Authors",Contourlet transform (CT); Quantum computing; Qubit; Variational quantum circuit (VQC),,Automatic malaria disease detection from blood cell images using the variational quantum circuit,YES

In many low and middle-income countries, TB remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Once a patient has been diagnosed with TB, it is critical that healthcare workers make the most appropriate treatment decision given the individual conditions of the patient and the likely course of the disease based on medical experience. Depending on the prognosis, delayed or inappropriate treatment can result in unsatisfactory results including the exacerbation of clinical symptoms, poor quality of life, and increased risk of death. This work benchmarks machine learning models to aid TB prognosis using a Brazilian health database of confirmed cases and deaths related to TB in the State of Amazonas. The goal is to predict the probability of death by TB thus aiding the prognosis of TB and associated treatment decision making process. In its original form, the data set comprised 36,228 records and 130 fields but suffered from missing, incomplete, or incorrect data. Following data cleaning and preprocessing, a revised data set was generated comprising 24,015 records and 38 fields, including 22,876 reported cured TB patients and 1139 deaths by TB. To explore how the data imbalance impacts model performance, two controlled experiments were designed using (1) imbalanced and (2) balanced data sets. The best result is achieved by the Gradient Boosting (GB) model using the balanced data set to predict TB-mortality, and the ensemble model composed by the Random Forest (RF), GB and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models is the best model to predict the cure class. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the pathophysiology and functional severity associated with different anthropometric phenotypes of SAM have never been well characterized. We compared clinical characteristics, biochemical features, and health and nutrition histories of nonedematous children with SAM who had (1) low WHZ only, (2) both low WHZ and low MUAC, or (3) low MUAC only. METHODS: In Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, and Liberia, we conducted a multicentric cohort study in uncomplicated, nonedematous children with SAM and low MUAC only (n = 161), low WHZ only (n = 138), or a combination of low MUAC and low WHZ (n = 152). Alongside routine anthropometric measurements, we collected a wide range of critical indicators of clinical and nutritional status and viability; these included serum leptin, an adipocytokine negatively associated with mortality risk in SAM. RESULTS: Median leptin levels at diagnosis were lower in children with low WHZ only (215.8 pg/ mL; P,.001) and in those with combined WHZ and MUAC deficits (180.1 pg/mL; P,.001) than in children with low MUAC only (331.50 pg/mL). The same pattern emerged on a wide range of clinical indicators, including signs of severe wasting, dehydration, serum ferritin levels, and caretaker-reported health deterioration, and was replicated across study sites. CONCLUSIONS: Illustrative of the likely heterogeneous functional severity of the different anthropometric phenotypes of SAM, our results confirm the need to retain low WHZ as an independent diagnostic criterion.

An automated classification system is capable of recognizing white blood cells that may help doctors to diagnose several diseases like malaria, anemia, leukemia, etc. Automated blood cell analysis allows fast and accurate outcomes and often involves broad data without performance negotiation. The state-of-The-Art systems use a lot of different stages (feature extraction, segmentation, pre-processing, etc.) to provide the automated blood cell analysis using blood smear images which is a lengthy process. To overcome these problems, this paper presents an efficient peripheral blood cell image recognition and classification using a combination of the salp swarm algorithm and the cat swarm optimization (SSPSO) algorithm-based optimized convolutional neural networks (SSPSO-CNN) method. This paper uses the CNN approach to classify five peripheral blood cells such as eosinophil, basophil, lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils without any human intervention. The other objective of this paper is to propose an improved version of salp swarm optimizer (SSO) using particle swarm optimization (PSO) to attain competitive classification performance over the database of the blood cell images. In this paper, the CNN uses VGG19 architecture for training purposes. The accuracy of the classification achieved with VGG19 models is 98%. The proposed model based on the CNN approach optimized by SSPSO achieves high classification accuracy and provides automatic peripheral blood cell classification. This method establishes the fine-Tuning process to develop a classifier trained using 10 674 images obtained from medical practice.

Recently, collective human intelligence (CoHI) was shown to exceed the diagnostic accuracy of individuals. Thus, diagnostic performance of CoHI (120 dermatologists) versus individual dermatologists versus two state-of-the-art CNN was investigated. Patients and Methods: Cross-sectional reader study with presentation of 30 clinical cases to 120 dermatologists. Six diagnoses were offered and votes collected via remote voting devices (quizzbox®, Quizzbox Solutions GmbH, Stuttgart, Germany). Dermatoscopic images were classified by a binary and multiclass CNN (FotoFinder Systems GmbH, Bad Birnbach, Germany). Three sets of diagnostic classifications were scored against ground truth: (1) CoHI, (2) individual dermatologists, and (3) CNN. Results: CoHI attained a significantly higher accuracy [95 % confidence interval] (80.0 % [62.7 %–90.5 %]) than individual dermatologists (75.7 % [73.8 %–77.5 %]) and CNN (70.0 % [52.1 %–83.3 %]; all P < 0.001) in binary classifications. Moreover, CoHI achieved a higher sensitivity (82.4 % [59.0 %–93.8 %]) and specificity (76.9 % [49.7 %–91.8 %]) than individual dermatologists (sensitivity 77.8 % [75.3 %–80.2 %], specificity 73.0 % [70.6 %–75.4 %]) and CNN (sensitivity 70.6 % [46.9 %–86.7 %], specificity 69.2 % [42.4 %–87.3 %]). The diagnostic accuracy of CoHI was superior to that of individual dermatologists (P < 0.001) in multiclass evaluation, with the accuracy of the latter comparable to multiclass CNN.

These alerts warned on the risks of an exponential increase in emergence of potentially pandemic zoonotic infectious diseases related to disruptive ecological niches in different regions of the globe, such as H1N1 Influenza, SARS, MERS, Zika, avian flu, swine flu, and Ebola, and also on the risks of a future and more lethal Disease X. We examine this global public health failure in anticipating and responding to the pandemic, stressing the urgent need for an innovative global pandemic preparedness system in the current transition from linear economy to a circular economy. Evidence provided here indicates that this novel preventive-based and resource-saving preparedness system could contribute to reverse the detrimental impacts of the pandemic on global economy and increase its resilience. Individual protection, contact tracing, and lockdown have proved to be just partially effective to respond to the spillover of viral zoonosis into the human population, and for most of these pathogens, vaccines are not yet available. As for COVID-19 vaccines, in spite of the extraordinary investments and unprecedented advances in innovative vaccines in few months, most of these products are expected to be available to more vulnerable developing countries’ populations only by mid-2022. Furthermore, even when these vaccines are available, constraints such as low efficacy, waning immunity, new concerning COVID-19 variants, adverse events, and vaccine hesitancy might possibly restrict their public health impact and could contribute to aggravate the pandemic scenario. Considering these constraints and the severe global economic and social crises resulting from the lack of adequate preparedness and delayed effective response to COVID-19 and possibly to a future Disease X, we propose a pro-active global eco-social pandemic preparedness system. This novel system, based on One Health paradigm and on artificial intelligence and machine learning, is expected to incorporate “spillover” foresight and management into global preparedness and timely response. Designed to mitigate damage from outbreaks and minimize human morbidity and mortality, this approach to pandemic foresight and preparedness will be key to prevent a global disaster. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Circular economy; COVID-19; Disease X; Ecology; Pandemic preparedness; Vaccines,,COVID-19 and Future Disease X in Circular Economy Transition: Redesigning Pandemic Preparedness to Prevent a Global Disaster,NO

The COVID-19 pandemic is a catastrophic event that has raised a number of psychological issues such as depression given abrupt social changes and lack of employment. Advancements of deep learning-based language models have been promising for sentiment analysis with data from social networks such as Twitter. Given the situation with COVID-19 pandemic, different countries had different peaks where rise and fall of new cases affected lock-downs which directly affected the economy and employment. During the rise of COVID-19 cases with stricter lock-downs, people have been expressing their sentiments in social media. This can provide a deep understanding of human psychology during catastrophic events. In this paper, we present a framework that employs deep learning-based language models via long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks for sentiment analysis during the rise of novel COVID-19 cases in India. The framework features LSTM language model with a global vector embedding and state-of-art BERT language model. We review the sentiments expressed for selective months in 2020 which covers the major peak of novel cases in India. Our framework utilises multi-label sentiment classification where more than one sentiment can be expressed at once. Our results indicate that the majority of the tweets have been positive with high levels of optimism during the rise of the novel COVID-19 cases and the number of tweets significantly lowered towards the peak. We find that the optimistic, annoyed and joking tweets mostly dominate the monthly tweets with much lower portion of negative sentiments. The predictions generally indicate that although the majority have been optimistic, a significant group of population has been annoyed towards the way the pandemic was handled by the authorities.

This paper presents a new data mining framework to identify the polarity in Twitter (Twitter, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA) users' sentiment by extracting data related to mefloquine as a malaria drug and analyze users' interactions and feedback. Methods: The framework consists of seven stages: collecting tweets related to mefloquine use, calculating TF-IDF scores for the words used in the tweets by preparing the collected data to be processed, performing a classification process for the constructed words list to produce three categories: positive, negative and neutral, performing a network analysis process to create a model for the tweets, identifying sub-graphs for this network model, calculating the module average opinion (MAO) and user average opinion (UAO) for all modules into network and, identifying the influential users in each module by performing the information brokers stage. Results: The results showed that the positive users' impression was 67.4% and the negative users' impression was 25.9% while the neutral users' opinion was 6.7%. Conclusions: Results also showed that the users who take advice from a physician before switching to mefloquine made up most of the positive users' opinions, while the negative opinions ranged from unavailability of the drug and the serious side effects that include long-term mental health problems and neurological side effects.

Methods and findings We used Botswana XPRES trial data for adult HIV clinic enrollees collected during 2012 to 2015 to develop a parsimonious multivariable prognostic model for active prevalent TB using both logistic regression and random forest machine learning approaches. A clinical score was derived by rescaling final model coefficients. The clinical score was developed using southern Botswana XPRES data and its accuracy validated internally, using northern Botswana data, and externally using 3 diverse cohorts of antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive and ART-experienced PLHIV enrolled in XPHACTOR, TB Fast Track (TBFT), and Gugulethu studies from South Africa (SA). Predictive accuracy of the clinical score was compared with the World Health Organization (WHO) 4-symptom TB screen. Among 5,418 XPRES enrollees, 2,771 were included in the derivation dataset; 67% were female, median age was 34 years, median CD4 was 240 cells/μL, 189 (7%) had undiagnosed prevalent TB, and characteristics were similar between internal derivation and validation datasets. Among XPHACTOR, TBFT, and Gugulethu cohorts, median CD4 was 400, 73, and 167 cells/μL, and prevalence of TB was 5%, 10%, and 18%, respectively. Factors predictive of TB in the derivation dataset and selected for the clinical score included male sex (1 point), ≥1 WHO TB symptom (7 points), smoking history (1 point), temperature >37.5°C (6 points), body mass index (BMI) <18.5kg/m2 (2 points), and severe anemia (hemoglobin <8g/dL) (3 points).

Negative predictive value (NPV) also increased 1%, 0.3%, 1.6%, and 1.7% in XPRES, XPHACTOR, TBFT, and Gugulethu cohorts, respectively, when the clinical score of ≥2 replaced WHO 4-symptom TB screen. Categorizing risk scores into low (<2), moderate (2 to 10), and high-risk categories (>10) yielded TB prevalence of 1%, 1%, 2%, and 6% in the lowest risk group and 33%, 22%, 26%, and 32% in the highest risk group for XPRES, XPHACTOR, TBFT, and Gugulethu cohorts, respectively. At clinical score ≥2, the number needed to screen (NNS) ranged from 5.0 in Gugulethu to 11.0 in XPHACTOR. Limitations include that the risk score has not been validated in resource-rich settings and needs further evaluation : and validation in contemporary cohorts in Africa and other resource-constrained settings. Conclusions The simple and feasible clinical score allowed for prioritization of sensitivity and NPV, which could facilitate reductions in mortality from undiagnosed TB and safer administration of TPT during proposed global scale-up efforts. Differentiation of risk by clinical score cutoff allows flexibility in designing differentiated HIV–TB care to maximize impact of available resources. © 2021 Public Library of Science.

Medical misinformation, such as antivaccine content propagating through social media, is associated with increases in vaccine delay and refusal. Our overall goal is to develop an automatic detector for antivaccine messages to counteract the negative impact that antivaccine messages have on the public health. Very few extant detection systems have considered multimodality of social media posts (images, texts, and hashtags), and instead focus on textual components, despite the rapid growth of photo-sharing applications (e.g., Instagram). As a result, existing systems are not sufficient for detecting antivaccine messages with heavy visual components (e.g., images) posted on these newer platforms. To solve this problem, we propose a deep learning network that leverages both visual and textual information. A new semantic- and task-level attention mechanism was created to help our model to focus on the essential contents of a post that signal antivaccine messages. The proposed model, which consists of three branches, can generate comprehensive fused features for predictions. Moreover, an ensemble method is proposed to further improve the final prediction accuracy. To evaluate the proposed model's performance, a real-world social media dataset that consists of more than 30,000 samples was collected from Instagram between January 2016 and October 2019. Our 30 experiment results demonstrate that the final network achieves above 97% testing accuracy and outperforms other relevant models, demonstrating that it can detect a large amount of antivaccine messages posted daily.

There was a positive association between official reporting and RVF events (odds ratio (OR) 195.5, 95% confidence interval (CI); 24.01–4756.43, p <0.001) and a negative association between official reporting and local media coverage of events (OR 0.03, 95% CI; 0.00–0.17, p = 0.030). This study highlights the usefulness of local news in the detection of potentially neglected zoonotic disease events and the importance of digital biosurveillance in resource-limited settings. © 2021 by the authors.

Ionophores have garnered interest as novel antimalarials due to their theorized ability to target unique systems found in the Plasmodium-infected erythrocyte. In this study, during the bioassay-guided fractionation of the crude extract of Streptomyces strain PR3, a group of cyclodepsipeptides, including valinomycin, and a novel class of cyclic ethers were identified and elucidated. Further study revealed that the ethers were cyclic polypropylene glycol (cPPG) oligomers that had leached into the bacterial culture from an extraction resin. Molecular dynamics analysis sug-gests that these ethers are able to bind cations such as K+, NH4+ and Na+ . Combination studies using the fixed ratio isobologram method revealed that the cPPGs synergistically improved the antiplas-modial activity of valinomycin and reduced its cytotoxicity in vitro. The IC50 of valinomycin against P. falciparum NF54 improved by 4–5-fold when valinomycin was combined with the cPPGs. Precisely, it was improved from 3.75 ± 0.77 ng/mL to 0.90 ± 0.2 ng/mL and 0.75 ± 0.08 ng/mL when dosed in the fixed ratios of 3:2 and 2:3 of valinomycin to cPPGs, respectively. Each fixed ratio combination displayed cytotoxicity (IC50) against the Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line of 57–65 µg/mL, which was lower than that of valinomycin (12.4 µg/mL). These results indicate that combinations with these novel ethers may be useful in repurposing valinomycin into a suitable and effective antimalarial. © 2021 by the authors.

We aimed to evaluate the capabilities of various hematological parameters observed early in the course of illness for predicting the clinical outcomes of illness. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the records of children admitted in the pediatric inpatient services of the institute with dengue between 2017 and 2019. We determined the relationships between the hematological parameters observed during the first evaluation and the various clinical outcomes. Results: We evaluated data from 613 patients (age range, 26 days to 17 years). Of these, 29.85% exhibited fever with warning signs, and 8.97% had severe dengue. Lower values of hemoglobin, platelet count, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and mean platelet volume, and higher values of total leukocyte count (TLC), hematocrit, and red cell distribution width variably correlated with numerous clinical outcomes—duration of hospital stay, development of complications, requirement of blood component transfusion, inotropic support, and mortality. Among the parameters, TLC ≥20,000/mL and initial platelet count ≤20,000/mL significantly associated with mortality, with odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of 11.81 (4.21–33.80) and 5.53 (1.90–16.09), respectively. Conclusions: Hematological parameters observed early during dengue infection may predict its clinical outcomes in infected children. Initial high TLC and low platelet count are potential predictors of fatal outcomes in the course of disease. © 2021, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical.

Indian traditional medicines, especially polyherbal formulations like Nilavembu Kudineer (NVK) and Kaba Sura Kudineer (KSK) of the Siddha system of medicine, have been used as public health interventions for controlling viral epidemics like dengue and Chikungunya. These traditional therapies have been found safe, effective, and widely accepted. The current study evaluates the comparative efficacy of NVK and KSK as opposed to the placebo, in the management of mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. Methods: The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparative clinical trial, with the primary objective of determining the efficacy of KSK and NVK. Patients (n=125) diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms were enrolled in the study over a period of 4 months (Aug 2020—Dec 2020). Participants were randomized into 3 arms; placebo-decaffeinated tea in Arm I, NVK in Arm II, and KSK in Arm III. Each arm received 60 ml of the respective treatment twice a day, post morning and evening meals, along with standard allopathy treatment for a maximum of 10 days. The main outcome measures of the study were the reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load, hospital stay, and time taken by the patients to become asymptomatic from symptomatic. Efficacy assessments included clinical symptoms (fever, cough, and breathlessness) each day and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), liver function test (LFT), renal function test (RFT), and electrolytes and electrocardiogram (ECG) at baseline (day 0) and days 3, 6, and 10. Post-treatment, participants were followed up for 30 days via phone for adverse effects if any. Effects of drugs on inflammatory markers (IL6) at the end of treatment were also recorded. Adverse events (AE) were monitored throughout the study. Results: The results revealed that when compared to patients in the placebo arm, those in NVK and KSK arms showed a statistically significant reduction in hospital stay time, reduction in viral load of SARS-CoV-2, and the time taken to become symptomatic from asymptomatic. Out of 125 COVID-19 patients recruited, 120 completed the study; two from the placebo group developed severe symptoms and were shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and three patients from Arms II and III withdrew from the study. The mean age of females (n=60) and males (n=60) enrolled was between 40.2 and 44.3 years, respectively. Results were more promising for all the patients in NVK and KSK arms as all enrolled participants (100%) under this group got discharged by day 6 as compared to only 42.5% (n=17) from the placebo group on that day. The hospital stay time for patients in Arm I was significantly longer (mean [SD]=8.4 [2.0] days) as compared to the Arms II and III (mean [SD]=4.7 [1.5] and 4.2 [1.5] days, respectively (Kruskal-Wallis test, P=0.0001). Patients in the three groups took a significantly different number of days to become asymptomatic. While Arm II and III patients took mean of 2.5 and 1.7 days, respectively, Arm I, patients took a mean of 4.2 days (Kruskal-Wallis test, P=0.0001). In all, two adverse events were recorded, one for vomiting and one for diarrhea lasting a day in Arm I and Arm II, respectively. The mean value of interleukin-6 (IL6) was significantly different in comparison to the placebo-decaffeinated tea arm (NVK=2.6 and KSK=2.2, placebo=4.0, P=0.02). The other blood biochemical parameters like C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and D-dimer that were analyzed at the baseline and at the time of discharge from the hospital, were not significantly different in the three arms. Conclusion: NVK and KSK arms showed a statistically significant reduction in hospital stay time, reduction in viral load of SARS-CoV-2, and time taken for patients to become asymptomatic from symptomatic, when compared to the placebo (decaffeinated tea). The primary outcome measures of the KSK arm were significantly better than those in the NVK arm. © 2021, The Author(s).",Double-blinded RCT; Kaba Sura Kudineer; Mild to moderate COVID-19; Nilavembu Kudineer; Siddha medicine,CCRS; Central Council for Research in Siddha; Government Institute of Medical Sciences; SRM Medical University; Siddha Clinical Research Unit; VMMC & Safdarjung Hospital,"Efficacy of two siddha polyherbal decoctions, Nilavembu Kudineer and Kaba Sura Kudineer, along with standard allopathy treatment in the management of mild to moderate symptomatic COVID-19 patients—a double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial",NO

We conducted a survey in Lincang City to determine the measles vaccination status of children on the China–Myanmar border. Methods: We used multistage sampling among children aged 8–83 months. Information on measles vaccination status was obtained from the child’s vaccination certificate, and serum samples were tested using commercially available ELISA kits. Results: A total of 938 children were surveyed. The vaccination coverage rate was 98.9% (95% CI: 98.2–99.6%) for measles–containing vaccine dose 1 (MCV1), and 95.8% (95% CI:94.9–96.7%) for measles–containing vaccine dose 2 (MCV2). The timely vaccination coverage rate was 52.0% (95% CI:48.8–55.2%) for MCV1, and 74.1% (95% CI: 82.9–89.0%) for MCV2. The timely-and–complete vaccination coverage rate was 41.0% (95% CI: 36.7–45.3%). The median delay period was 33 (95% CI: 27–39) days for MCV1, and 196 (95% CI: 146–246) days for MCV2. The seropositivity rate in children aged less than 7 years was 94.0% (95% CI: 92.5–95.5%) with a geometric mean titer of 1210.1 mIU/mL. Conclusions: The MCV coverage was high, but timely and timely-and-complete vaccination coverage were low and insufficient to prevent measles outbreaks.

Severe dengue (SD), experienced by only a fraction of dengue patients, can be lethal. Due to the lack of early markers that can predict the evolution of SD, all dengue patients have to be monitored under hospital care. We discovered early oxidative stress markers of SD to identify patients who can benefit from early intervention before the symptoms appear. Methods. The expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in peripheral blood cells (PBC), nitric oxide (NO), and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) levels in plasma and saliva collected at early stages of dengue infection from 20 nonsevere dengue fever (DF) patients and 20 patients who later developed SD were analyzed in a retrospective nested case-control study. Results. The expression of iNOS is significantly (P<0.05) lower in patients who developed SD than in DF patients at admission within 4 days from fever onset. Median plasma NO concentration within 4 days from fever onset is also significantly (P<0.05) lower in patients who developed SD (17.9±1.6 μmol/L) than DF (23.0±2.1 μmol/L). Median oxLDL levels in plasma within 3 days from fever onset is significantly (P<0.05) lower in patients who developed SD (509.4±224.1 ng/mL) than DF (740.0±300.0 ng/mL). Median salivary oxLDL levels are also significantly (P<0.05) lower in patients who developed SD (0.8±0.5 ng/mL) than DF (3.6±2.6 ng/mL) within 4 days from fever onset. Conclusions. These findings suggest that the expression of iNOS (73% sensitivity, 86% specificity) and plasma NO (96% sensitivity, 61% specificity at 22.3 μmol/L; P<0.05) may serve as early markers of SD within 3 days from fever onset. Salivary oxLDL levels may serve as early noninvasive markers of SD with a sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of 57% and 91% at 0.9 ng/mL; 76% and 55% at 2.3 ng/mL; and 100% and 50% at 4.6 ng/mL (P<0.05) within 4 days from fever onset. © 2021 Harsha Hapugaswatta et al.",,,Expression of Nitric Oxide Synthase and Nitric Oxide Levels in Peripheral Blood Cells and Oxidized Low-Density Lipoprotein Levels in Saliva as Early Markers of Severe Dengue,NO

Fluid extravasation during the critical phase of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) leads to shock, multi-organ failure and death if not resuscitated appropriately with fluids. The mainstay of management is judicious fluid replacement using a guideline based, calculated fluid quota of maintenance (M) fluid plus 5% deficit (M + 5% deficit) to prevent organ hypoperfusion. Methods: We conducted an observational follow-up study in Sri Lanka from January–July 2017 to identify the fluid requirements of DHF patients and to identify whether features of fluid overload are present in patients who exceeded the fluid quota. Patients who developed DHF following admission to the place of study, were recruited and the amount of fluid received during the critical phase was documented. Results: A total of 115 DHF patients with a mean age of 30.3 (SD 12.2) years were recruited to the study. There were 65 (56.5%) males and the mean fluid requirement was 5279.7 ml (SD 735) over the 48 h. Majority of the study participants (n = 80, 69.6%) received fluid in excess of the recommended maintenance + 5% deficit and this group had higher body mass index (22.75 vs 20.76, p0.03) and a lower white cell count at the onset of the critical phase (3.22 × 103 vs 4.78 × 103, p < 0.001). The highest fluid requirement was seen within the first 12 and 24 h of the critical phase in patients requiring fluid M + 5%–7.5% deficit and ≥ M + 7.5% deficit respectively. Patients exceeding M + 5% deficit had narrow pulse pressure and hypotension compared to the rest. DHF grades III and IV were seen exclusively in patients exceeding the fluid quota indicating higher amount of fluid was given for resuscitation. Fluid overload was detected in 14 (12.1%) patients and diuretic therapy was required in 6 (5.2%) patients. Conclusions: The majority of patients received fluid in excess of the recommended quota and this group represents patients with narrow pulse pressure and hypotension. Although, fluid overload was infrequent in the study population, clinicians should be cautious when administering fluid in excess of M + 7.5% deficit. © 2021, The Author(s).",Critical phase; Dengue fever; Dengue haemorrhagic fever; Fluid leakage; Fluid overload; Fluid requirement,,Fluid requirement in adult dengue haemorrhagic fever patients during the critical phase of the illness: an observational study,NO

Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a biomarker involved in the mechanism of fibrosis and inflammation that may be useful for risk stratification of individuals with ChD. Objectives: We sought to evaluate whether high Gal-3 levels are associated with severe forms of Chagas cardiomyopathy (CC) and whether they are predictive of mortality. Methods: We studied anti-T. cruzi positive blood donors (BD): Non-CC-BD (187 BD without CC with normal electrocardiogram [ECG] and left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]); CC-Non-Dys-BD (46 BD with CC with abnormal ECG but normal LVEF); and 153 matched serum-negative controls. This cohort was composed of 97 patients with severe CC (CC-Dys). We used Kruskall-Wallis and Spearman’s correlation to test hypothesis of associations, assuming a two-tailed p<0.05 as significant. Results: The Gal-3 level was 12.3 ng/mL for Non-CC-BD, 12.0 ng/mL for CC-Non-Dys-BD, 13.8 ng/mL for controls, and 15.4 ng/mL for CC-Dys. LVEF<50 was associated with higher Gal-3 levels (p=0.0001). In our linear regression adjusted model, we found association between Gal-3 levels and echocardiogram parameters in T. cruzi-seropositive subjects. In CC-Dys patients, we found a significant association of higher Gal-3 levels (≥15.3 ng/mL) and subsequent death or heart transplantation in a 5-year follow-up (Hazard ratio – HR 3.11; 95%CI 1.21–8.04; p=0.019).

This study attempts to identify high risk areas of schistosomiasis in China by using information value and machine learning. Methods: The local case distribution from schistosomiasis surveillance data in China between 2005 and 2019 was assessed based on 19 variables including climate, geography, and social economy. Seven models were built in three categories including information value (IV), three machine learning models [logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), generalized boosted model (GBM)], and three coupled models (IV + LR, IV + RF, IV + GBM). Accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), and F1-score were used to evaluate the prediction performance of the models. The optimal model was selected to predict the risk distribution for schistosomiasis. Results: There is a more prone to schistosomiasis epidemic provided that paddy fields, grasslands, less than 2.5 km from the waterway, annual average temperature of 11.5–19.0 °C, annual average rainfall of 1000–1550 mm. IV + GBM had the highest prediction effect (accuracy = 0.878, AUC = 0.902, F1 = 0.920) compared with the other six models. The results of IV + GBM showed that the risk areas are mainly distributed in the coastal regions of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the Poyang Lake region, and the Dongting Lake region. High-risk areas are primarily distributed in eastern Changde, western Yueyang, northeastern Yiyang, middle Changsha of Hunan province; southern Jiujiang, northern Nanchang, northeastern Shangrao, eastern Yichun in Jiangxi province; southern Jingzhou, southern Xiantao, middle Wuhan in Hubei province; southern Anqing, northwestern Guichi, eastern Wuhu in Anhui province; middle Meishan, northern Leshan, and the middle of Liangshan in Sichuan province. Conclusions: The risk of schistosomiasis transmission in China still exists, with high-risk areas relatively concentrated in the coastal regions of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Coupled models of IV and machine learning provide for effective analysis and prediction, forming a scientific basis for evidence-lead surveillance and control.

This study explored the feasibility of a random forest algorithm weighted by spatial distance for risk prediction of schistosomiasis distribution in the Yangtze River Basin in China, with the aim to produce an improved precision reference for the national schistosomiasis control programme by reducing the number of snail survey sites without losing predictive accuracy. Methods: The snail presence and absence records were collected from Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi and Jiangsu provinces in 2018. A machine learning of random forest algorithm based on a set of environmental and climatic variables was developed to predict the breeding sites of the O. hupensis intermediated snail host of S. japonicum. Different spatial sizes of a hexagonal grid system were compared to estimate the need for required snail sampling sites. The predictive accuracy related to geographic distances between snail sampling sites was estimated by calculating Kappa and the area under the curve (AUC). Results: The highest accuracy (AUC = 0.889 and Kappa = 0.618) was achieved at the 5 km distance weight. The five factors with the strongest correlation to O. hupensis infestation probability were: (1) distance to lake (48.9%), (2) distance to river (36.6%), (3) isothermality (29.5%), (4) mean daily difference in temperature (28.1%), and (5) altitude (26.0%). The risk map showed that areas characterized by snail infestation were mainly located along the Yangtze River, with the highest probability in the dividing, slow-flowing river arms in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in Anhui, followed by areas near the shores of China’s two main lakes, the Dongting Lake in Hunan and Hubei and the Poyang Lake in Jiangxi. Conclusions: Applying the machine learning of random forest algorithm made it feasible to precisely predict snail infestation probability, an approach that could improve the sensitivity of the Chinese schistosome surveillance system.

IL-13 may contribute to the disease outcomes by increasing eosinophil infiltration thereby promoting fibrosis. IL-13 may act as an immunosuppressive inflammatory cytokine that may promote carcinogenesis and also may offer protection against schistosomiasis thereby reducing risk of schistosome infections. Our study evaluated the frequency of the IL-13 rs1800925/-1112 C/ T promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among schistosomiasis infected individuals and assessed the association of the variants on IL-13 cytokine levels. We also investigated IL-13 rs1800925 polymorphisms on prostate-specific antigen levels as an indicator for risk of prostate cancer development. Methodology The study was cross-sectional and included 50 schistosomiasis infected and 316 uninfected male participants residing in Murehwa District, Zimbabwe. IL-13 rs1800925 SNPs were genotyped by allele amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction. Concentrations of serum prostate-specific antigens and plasma IL-13 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results Frequencies of the genotypes CC, CT and TT, were 20%, 58% and 22% in schistosomiasis infected, and 18.3%, 62.1% and 19.6% in uninfected participants with no statistical differences. There were significantly (p<0.05) higher IL-13 cytokine levels among both infected and uninfected participants with the genotypes CC and CT; median 92.25 pg/mL and 106.5 pg/mL, respectively, compared to TT variant individuals; 44.78 pg/mL. Within the schistosomiasis uninfected group, CC and CT variants had significantly (p<0.05) higher IL-13 levels; median 135.0 pg/mL and 113.6 pg/mL, respectively compared to TT variant individuals; 47.15 pg/mL. Within the schistosomiasis infected group, CC, CT and TT variant individuals had insignificant differences of IL-13 level. Using logistic regression, no association was observed between prostate-specific antigen levels, IL-13 cytokine levels and IL-13 rs1800925 variants (p>0.05). Conclusion IL-13 rs1800925 C variant individuals had the highest IL-13 cytokine levels among the schistosomiasis uninfected suggesting that they may be protective against Schistosoma infections. There was no association between IL-13 concentrations or IL-13 rs1800925 variants and risk of prostate cancer indicating that IL-13 levels and IL-13 rs10800925 may not be utilised as biomarker for risk of prostate cancer in schistosome infections.

The bark of Annickia polycarpa is an effective anti-malaria agent in African traditional medicine. However, there is no standardization parameters for A. polycarpa. The anti-malaria properties of its leaf are also not known. Aim of the study: To standardize the ethanol leaf extract of A. polycarpa (APLE) and investigate its anti-malaria properties and the effect of its treatment on hematological indices in Plasmodium berghei infected mice in the Rane's test. Materials and methods: Malaria was induced by inoculating female ICR mice with 1.0 × 107 P. berghei-infected RBCs in 0.2 mL (i.p.) of blood. Treatment was commenced 3 days later with APLE 50, 200, 400 mg/kg p.o., Quinine 30 mg/kg i.m. (Standard drug) or sterile water (Negative control) once daily per group for 4 successive days. Anti-malarial activity and gross malaria indices such as hyperparasitemia, mean change in body weight and mean survival time (MST) were determined for each group. Changes in white blood cells (WBCs), red blood cells (RBCs), platelets (PLT) counts, hemoglobin (HGB) concentration, hematocrit (HCT) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) were also measured in the healthy mice before infection as baseline and on day 3 and 8 after inoculation using complete blood count. Standardization was achieved by UHPLC-MS chemical fingerprint analysis and quantitative phytochemical tests. Results: APLE, standardized to its total alkaloids, phenolics and saponin contents, produced significant (P < 0.05) dose-dependent clearance of mean hyperparasitemia of 22.78 ± 0.93% with the minimum parasitemia level of 2.01 ± 0.25% achieved at 400 mg/kg p.o. on day 8. Quinine 30 mg/kg i.m. achieved a minimum parasitemia level of 6.15 ± 0.92%. Moreover, APLE (50–400 mg/kg p.o.) evoked very significant anti-malaria activity of 89.22–95.50%. Anti-malaria activity of Quinine 30 mg/kg i.m. was 86.22%. APLE also inverse dose-dependently promotes weight gain with the effect being significant (P < 0.05) at 50 mg/kg p.o. Moreover, APLE dose-dependently increased the MST of malaria infested mice with 100% survival at 400 mg/kg p.o. Quinine 30 mg/kg i.m. also produce 100% survival rate but did not promote (P > 0.05) weight gain. Hematological studies revealed the development of leukocytopenia, erythrocytosis, microcytic anemia and thrombocytopenia in the malaria infected mice which were reverted with the treatment of APLE 50–400 mg/kg p.o. or Quinine 30 mg/kg i.m. but persisted in the negative control. The UHPLC-MS fingerprint analysis of APLE led to identification of one oxoaporphine and two aporphine alkaloids (1–3). Alkaloids 1 and 3 are being reported in this plant for the first time. Conclusion: These results indicate that APLE possessed significant anti-malaria, immunomodulatory, erythropoietic and hematinic actions against malaria infection. APLE also has the ability to revoke deleterious physiological alteration produced by malaria and hence, promote clinical cure. These properties of APLE are due to its constituents especially, aporphine and oxoaporphine alkaloids. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Anemia; Annickia polycarpa leaf; Aporphine alkaloids; Hemoglobin; Hyperparasitemia; Malaria; Oxoaporphine alkalod; UHPLC-MS chemical Fingerprint analysis,CPMR,"Intervention of standardized ethanol leaf extract of Annickia polycarpa, (DC.)

Recently, an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled ECG algorithm showed excellent accuracy to detect LVSD in a general population, but its accuracy in ChD has not been tested. Objective To analyze the ability of AI to recognize LVSD in patients with ChD, defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction determined by the Echocardiogram ≤ 40%. Methodology/principal findings This is a cross-sectional study of ECG obtained from a large cohort of patients with ChD named São Paulo-Minas Gerais Tropical Medicine Research Center (SaMi-Trop) Study. The digital ECGs of the participants were submitted to the analysis of the trained machine to detect LVSD. The diagnostic performance of the AI-enabled ECG to detect LVSD was tested using an echocardiogram as the gold standard to detect LVSD, defined as an ejection fraction <40%. The model was enriched with NT-proBNP plasma levels, male sex, and QRS ≥ 120ms. Among the 1,304 participants of this study, 67% were women, median age of 60; there were 93 (7.1%) individuals with LVSD. Most patients had major ECG abnormalities (59.5%). The AI algorithm identified LVSD among ChD patients with an odds ratio of 63.3 (95% CI 32.3–128.9), a sensitivity of 73%, a specificity of 83%, an overall accuracy of 83%, and a negative predictive value of 97%; the AUC was 0.839. The model adjusted for the male sex and QRS ≤ 120ms improved the AUC to 0.859. The model adjusted for the male sex and elevated NT-proBNP had a higher accuracy of 0.89 and an AUC of 0.874.

While such vaccines are successfully used worldwide, the period between vaccine boosters required to guarantee protection of the population against rabies varies between vaccines and populations. In Flores Island, Indonesia, internationally and locally produced rabies vaccines are used during annual vaccination campaigns of predominantly free-roaming owned domestic dogs. The study objective was to identify the duration of the presence and factors associated with the loss of adequate level of binding antibodies (≥0.5 EU/ml) following rabies vaccination in a domestic dog population on Flores Island. A total of 171 dogs that developed an antibody titre higher or equal to 0.5 EU/ml 30 days after vaccination (D30), were repeatedly sampled at day 90, 180, 270, and 360 after vaccination. On the day of vaccination (D0), an interview was performed with dog owners to collect information on dog characteristics (age, sex, body condition score (BCS)), history of rabies vaccination, kind of daily food, frequency of feeding, and origin of the dog. Serum samples were collected and the level of antibodies was quantitatively assessed using ELISA tests. Dogs were categorized as having an adequate level of binding antibodies (≥0.5 EU/ml) or inadequate level of binding antibodies (<0.5 EU/ml) at each time points examined. A total of 115, 72, 23, and 31 dogs were sampled at D90, D180, D270, and D360, respectively, with the highest proportion of antibodies ≥ 0.5 EU/ml (58%, 95% CI, 49–67%) at D90, which reduced gradually until D360 (35%, 95% CI, 19–52%). Multivariable logistic regression models showed that loss of adequate level of binding antibodies is significantly associated with dogs having no history of vaccination or vaccination applied more than 12 months before D0, being less than 12 months of age, and having a poor BCS. These results highlight the importance of BCS regarding the immune response duration and provide insights into frequency of vaccination campaigns required for the internationally available vaccine used on Flores Island. For dogs without vaccination history or vaccination being applied more than 12 months before D0, a booster is recommended within 3 months (a largest drop of antibodies was detected within the first 90 days) after the first vaccination to guarantee measurable protection of the population that lasts at least for one year. © 2021 Wera et al.",,"Kupang State Agricultural Polytechnic; Politeknik Pertanian Negeri Kupang, (1/P2M/DIPA.042.01.2.40.1014/2019); Wolfermann-Nägeli Stiftung, (2018/28); Albert-Heim-Stiftung, AHS, (132)","Loss of binding antibodies against rabies in a vaccinated dog population in Flores Island, Indonesia",NO

The current traditional quarantine methods using remote body thermometers as well as questionnaires have not been highly effective due environment and subjective human factors. The use of Machine Learning algorithms may be more objective and optimal for this purpose. Methods: In this paper, a non-contact measuring system using medical radar is proposed to acquire data. Then, data captured from this radar is passed through filters to both eliminate interference and to provide vital parameters such as heart and respiration rate. Finally, the classification between healthy and infected people is executed by using five Machine learning algorithms. With the measured dataset, the classification models are built through training and test steps. Results: The classification results of the algorithms are evaluated based on the f1-score parameter with accuracy greater than 80%. In particular, the Deep Learning algorithms gives the highest result of 98%. Conclusion: This study implements patient classification algorithms, which achieved good performance. This might be beneficial for rapid screening of infected patients at public health centers in underdeveloped areas, where people have little access to healthcare.

Although the Zika virus (ZIKV) seems to be prominently neurotropic, there are some reports of involvement of other organs, particularly the heart. Of special concern are those children exposed prenatally to ZIKV and born without microcephaly or other congenital anomalies. Electrocardiogram (ECG) - derived heart rate variability (HRV) metrics represent an attractive, low-cost, widely deployable tool for early identification of developmental functional alterations in exposed children born without such overt clinical symptoms. We hypothesized that HRV in such children would yield a biomarker of fetal ZIKV exposure. Our objective was to test this hypothesis in young children exposed to ZIKV during pregnancy. Approach. We investigated the HRV properties of 21 children aged 4-25 months from Brazil. The infants were divided into two groups, the ZIKV-exposed (n = 13) and controls (n = 8). Single-channel ECG was recorded in each child at ∼15 months of age and HRV was analyzed in 5 min segments to provide a comprehensive characterization of the degree of variability and complexity of the heart rate. Main results. Using a cubic support vector machine classifier we identified babies as Zika cases or controls with a negative predictive value of 92% and a positive predictive value of 86%. Our results show that a machine learning model derived from HRV metrics can help differentiate between ZIKV-affected, yet asymptomatic, and non-ZIKV-exposed babies. We identified the box count as the best HRV metric in this study allowing such differentiation, regardless of the presence of microcephaly. Significance. We show that it is feasible to measure HRV in infants and toddlers using a small non-invasive portable ECG device and that such an approach may uncover the memory of in utero exposure to ZIKV. We discuss putative mechanisms. This approach may be useful for future studies and low-cost screening tools involving this challenging to examine population.  © 2021 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",ECG; HRV; infection; pediatrics; Zika,,Machine learning model on heart rate variability metrics identifies asymptomatic toddlers exposed to zika virus during pregnancy,YES

Here, we extend a previous study in which a number of partners collaborated to develop a consensus in silico model that can be used to identify novel molecules that may have antimalarial properties. The performance of machine learning methods generally improves with the number of data points available for training.

Microscopy by thick smear blood films is the conventional method for malaria parasitemia determination. Despite its edge over other existing methods of malaria parasitemia determination, it has been critiqued for being laborious, time consuming and equally requires expert knowledge for an efficient manual quantification of the parasitemia. This pauses a big challenge to most low developing countries as they are not only highly endemic but equally low resourced in terms of technical personnel in medical laboratories This study presents an end-to-end deep learning approach to automate the localization and count of P.falciparum parasites and White Blood Cells (WBCs) for effective parasitemia determination. The method involved building computer vision models on a dataset of annotated thick blood smear images. These computer vision models were built based on pre-trained deep learning models including Faster Regional Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) and Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) models that help process the obtained digital images. To improve model performance due to a limited dataset, data augmentation was applied. Results from the evaluation of our approach showed that it reliably detected and returned a count of parasites and WBCs with good precision and recall. A strong correlation was observed between our model-generated counts and the manual counts done by microscopy experts (posting a spear man correlation of ρ = 0.998 for parasites and ρ = 0.987 for WBCs). Additionally, our proposed SSD model was quantized and deployed on a mobile smartphone-based inference app to detect malaria parasites and WBCs in situ.

Applying these approaches to drug repurposing (DR) studies can identify new relationships between drug molecules, therapeutic targets and diseases that will eventually help in generating new insights for developing novel therapeutics. In the current study, a dataset of 1671 approved drugs is analyzed using a combined approach involving unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) techniques (Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by k-means clustering) and Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR) predictions for DR. PCA is applied on all the two dimensional (2D) molecular descriptors of the dataset and the first five Principal Components (PC) were subsequently used to cluster the drugs into nine well separated clusters using k-means algorithm. We further predicted the biological activities for the drug-dataset using the PASS (Predicted Activities Spectra of Substances) tool. These predicted activity values are analyzed systematically to identify repurposable drugs for various diseases. Clustering patterns obtained from k-means showed that every cluster contains subgroups of structurally similar drugs that may or may not have similar therapeutic indications. We hypothesized that such structurally similar but therapeutically different drugs can be repurposed for the native indications of other drugs of the same cluster based on their high predicted biological activities obtained from PASS analysis. In line with this, we identified 66 drugs from the nine clusters which are structurally similar but have different therapeutic uses and can therefore be repurposed for one or more native indications of other drugs of the same cluster. Some of these drugs not only share a common substructure but also bind to the same target and may have a similar mechanism of action, further supporting our hypothesis. Furthermore, based on the analysis of predicted biological activities, we identified 1423 drugs that can be repurposed for 366 new indications against several diseases. In this study, an integrated approach of unsupervised ML and SAR analysis have been used to identify new indications for approved drugs and the study provides novel insights into clustering patterns generated through descriptor level analysis of approved drugs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Approved drugs; Clustering; Dimensionality reduction; Drug repurposing; PASS; Unsupervised learning,"Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी, (16-45-02012, INT/RUS/RSF/12, SR/WOS-A/CS-1091/2014)",Molecular descriptor analysis of approved drugs using unsupervised learning for drug repurposing,YES
2021.0,surveillance,"Department of Computer Science, African University of Science and Technology, Abuja, Nigeria","Malaria remains a serious obstacle to socio-economic development in Africa. It was estimated that about 90% of the deaths occurred in Africa, where various factors such as ecosystem and climate conditions are favorable to species of mosquitoes transmitting the malaria parasite. Some malaria epidemic prediction systems have been built to mitigate the increase of the disease outbreaks in some African countries; however, there is a need for better models with improved prediction ability based on non-seasonal variations in climatic conditions. This research proposes a machine learning-based model for the classification of malaria incidence using climate variability across six countries of Sub-Saharan Africa over a period of twenty-eight years. The work begins with a feature engineering process, which identifies the climate factors that affect the incidence of malaria, followed by the k-means clustering process for outlier detection, and then, XGBoost algorithm for classification. The results suggest that although the exact association between malaria incidence and climate variability varies from one geographic region to another, the non-seasonal changes in three climatic factors (precipitation, temperature, and surface radiation) significantly contribute to the outbreak of malaria. The proposed system was compared with other classification models, and the comparative results showed that the proposed system outperformed other classification models. The malaria incidence classification model is an early detection mechanism that helps to monitor the spread of malaria; it is a unique data-driven knowledge discovery system that will assist public health authorities in learning the effects of climate factors on health and also in developing relevant preventive and adaptive mechanisms to ensure a timelier health service in order to save lives. © 2020 The Author(s)",Climate variability; Machine learning for healthcare and data mining; Malaria incidence; XGBoost,,Prediction of malaria incidence using climate variability and machine learning,YES

Most studies have used renal biopsy, and ultrasonography in the diagnosis of renal damage among urogenital schistosomiasis affected individuals. This study assessed serum urea, creatinine, and eGFR as biochemical markers of renal abnormalities in children with urogenital schistosomiasis (Schistosoma haematobium) at a resource limited setting in Sorodofo-Abaasa in the Central Region of Ghana. A case–control study was conducted among 116 basic school children aged 9 to 17 years from January 2015 to May 2015 at Sorodofo-Abaasa in the Abura Asebu Kwamankese District of the Central Region of Ghana. A pre-tested questionnaire was used to obtain information on age, sex, guardian’s occupation, water contact activities, history of gross haematuria and history of medication. Participants weight and height were measured using a bathroom scale (Zhongshan Camry Electronic Co. Ltd, Guangdong-China) and a wall-mounted ruler to the nearest 0.1 kg and 0.1 cm respectively. Approximately 4 ml of venous blood sample was collected from the median cubital vein of the study participants and used for the estimation of serum urea and creatinine levels. eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) was calculated using the Schwartz equation. The average ages of the cases and the controls recruited in this study were 12.7 ± 1.0 and 12. ± 2.6 years respectively. The median (minimum–maximum) did not differ between cases and controls with regards to eGFR [115.92(62.40–164.98) vs 112.50(51.82–170.36; p = 0.806], serum creatinine [57.20(28.91–84.67) vs 58.19(25.17–90.21); p = 0.876], and urea [9.82(5.80–13.74) vs 10.21(7.29–13.03); p = 0.586]. Hyperfiltration though statistically similar (p = 0.787), was observed among a higher proportion of the controls (20.5%) than observed among the cases (18.4%). This study documented no significant differences between children with light (less than 50 ova per 10 ml urine) and heavy (more than 50 ova per 10 ml urine) infection.

Antibodies to VAR2CSA are associated with improved pregnancy outcomes. Antibody avidity is a surrogate marker for the extent of maturation of the humoral immune response. Little is known about high avidity Abs to VAR2CSA for women living in urban African cities. Therefore, this study sought to determine: i) if high avidity Abs to full-length VAR2CSA (FV2) increase with gravidity in women in Yaoundé, Cameroon exposed to ~ 0.3-1.1 infectious mosquito bites per month, ii) if high avidity Abs to FV2 are directed against a specific region of VAR2CSA, and iii) if having high avidity Abs to FV2 improve pregnancy outcomes. Plasma samples collected at delivery from 695 women who had Abs to FV2 were evaluated. Ab levels and the Avidity Index (AI), defined as the percent Abs remaining bound to FV2 after incubation with 3M NH4SCN, were determined. Similar Ab levels to FV2 were present in women of all gravidities (G1 through 6+; p=0.80), except significantly lower levels were detected in PM−negative (PM−) primigravidae (p <0.001). Median Ab avidities increased between gravidity 1 and 2 (p<0.001) and remained stable thereafter (G3-G6+: p=0.51). These results suggest that B cell clonal expansion began during the first pregnancy, with clonal selection primarily occurring during the second. However, the majority of women (84%) had AI <35, a level of high avidity Abs previously reported to be associated with improved pregnancy outcomes. When plasma from 107 Cameroonian women was tested against 8 different regions of FV2, high avidity Abs were predominately restricted to DBL5 with median AI of 50 compared to AI <25 for the other domains. The only significance influence of high avidity Abs on pregnancy outcome was that babies born to mothers with AI above the median were 104 g heavier than babies born to women with AI below the median (p=0.045). These results suggest that a vaccine that boosts maturation of the immune response to VAR2CSA may be beneficial for women residing in urban areas. © Copyright © 2021 Vanda, Bobbili, Matsunaga, Chen, Salanti, Leke and Taylor.",antibody avidity; placental malaria; Plasmodium falciparum; pregnant women; urban cities; VAR2CSA,"National Institutes of Health, NIH, (UO1AI35839); National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID; National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, NIMHD, (U54MD007601)","The Development, Fine Specificity, and Importance of High-Avidity Antibodies to VAR2CSA in Pregnant Cameroonian Women Living in Yaoundé, an Urban City",NO

Malondialdehyde (MDA), a product of lipid peroxidation and glutathione (GSH) has been suggested as a biomarker of oxidative stress. The Ethyl acetate (EA) fraction from the ethanol extract of Andrographis paniculata was shown to inhibit Plasmodium berghei in vivo. However, the antimalarial mechanism of the EA fraction, specifically on oxidative stress has not been investigated previously. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of the EA fraction on parasitemia levels, GSH and MDA levels of P. berghei infected rats. Methods: Female Wistar rats infected with P. berghei were divided into three groups. Group one received no treatment (negative control), group two was treated with 1.4 mg/200 g body weight of chloroquine diphosphate as positive control, and group three was treated with the EA fraction at a dose equal to andrographolide 3.5 mg/200 g body weight. The treatments lasted for four days (day 0 to day 3) and parasitemia was observed from day 0 to day 4. Rats were sacrificed and blood taken intracardially on day 4 after parasitemia observation. GSH was measured using an ELISA reader at a wavelength of 415 nm. MDA was observed via spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 532 nm. Results: The EA fraction at a dose equal to andrographolide 3.5 mg/200 g body weight was able to inhibit parasite growth by 81.97±9.14%. The GSH levels of the negative control, positive control and EA fraction treated group were 139.30±75.93 μMol/mL, 81.06±53.26 μMol/mL and 105.71±76.00 μMol/mL, respectively. Furthermore, the MDA level of negative control, positive control and EA fraction treated group were 11.18±0.70 nMol mL, 8.81±1.26 nMol/mL and 9.40±0.74 nMol/mL, respectively. No significant differences were detected between treatment groups regarding their GSH levels. Additionally, there was a significant difference in MDA levels between the negative control and positive control groups; as well as a significant difference between the negative control and the EA treated group. However, no significant difference in MDA levels between the EA fraction treated group and positive control group. Interestingly, a correlation was found between parasite growth inhibition and MDA levels among groups (p<0.05). Conclusion: The EA fraction of A. paniculata significantly decreased MDA levels which correlated significantly with parasitemia levels of P. berghei infected rats. The antimalarial activity of the EA fraction may have been correlated with oxidative stress mechanisms and this correlation could be explained in part by the decreased production of MDA. © RJPT All right reserved.",Andrographis paniculata; Ethyl acetate fraction; Oxidative stress; Plasmodium berghei; Rattus novergicus,"Directorate General of Research Technology and Higher Education, (266/UN3.14/LT/2015); Institute of Tropical Disease; Natural Product Medicine Research and Development; Universitas Airlangga, UNAIR",The Effect of Andrographis paniculata Nees on Oxidative Stress and Parasitemia Levels of Plasmodium berghei Infected Rats,NO

It is widespread across the world, particularly in tropical regions, and if not treated in time, it can be deadly. Thus, early and effective treatment and diagnosis of malaria will save lives. Modern machine learning and image analysis methods are practiced on microscopic images of blood smears by using hand-crafted features that need expertise in interpreting these features. In contrast, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proved to be adequate in feature extraction and classification of parasite detection toward malaria diagnosis. CNNs’ techniques can extract highly influenced features, determine filters to serve as an effective prediction that provides an accurate detection to aid malaria diagnosis. The motivation of the research is to state the significance of deep learning techniques in the diagnosis of malaria. This research proposes the convolution Siamese network (CSN) for a one-shot recognition method for parasite recognition in microscopic images. In this study, microscopic images were used to examine the performance of the CSN model, and it will assist in diagnosing various infectious diseases rapidly. CSN is implemented in a two-phase criteria to detect similarity or dissimilarity. The first phase consists of extracting detailed features using a fully connected convolutional block and the second phase consists of a similarity check where inputs are discriminated with similarity measures (L1, L2). This discriminated feature is fed forward to the final layer with a sigmoid function that depicts whether it is similar to the given input. Further, the proposed model is evaluated to attain optimum generalization, and its performance is captured by splitting data into identical divisions (50-50). As the model is trained only on half the malaria blood samples, it gives precisive generalization and attains malaria test accuracy scores of 87.10% and 87.38% with L 1 and L 2, respectively. We also depicted the mean square error (MSE) rate and confusion matrix for each to incorporate the performance for similar and dissimilar identification individually. The evolution of these metrics described the stability of the proposed network. Experiments and results have proven that the proposed CSN can leverage performance and build comprehensive models with fewer samples.

In machine learning or deep learning, quantity and quality of medical image dataset plays a important role for ensuring the accuracy of future prediction. Otherwise because of less number of poor quality images, machine or deep learning models fail to predict accurately. This limitation of less quantity and less quality medical image dataset is almost removed to major extent by the transfer learning concept of deep learning. Transfer learning concept of deep learning makes the pertained models available for customization to specific application needs. Either pre-trained models are fine-tuned on the underlying data or used as feature extractors. As these pertained models are already trained on large datasets, the accurate set of generic features can be extracted to improve the overall performance and computational complexity. Because of transfer learning, limitation of large dataset requirement is removed to a greater extent and also the training cost in terms of number of parameters to be learned, training time, hardware computing cost is reduced.

2021.0,diagnosis,"Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Research in Tribal Health, Madhya Pradesh, Jabalpur, India","Tuberculosis (TB) and leprosy (caused by mycobacterial pathogens) are two age-old infections, which we are facing even today. India is a major contributor to the global burden of leprosy and tuberculosis, which adversely affects the diverse communities as well as having a prevalence in different parts of the country. Timely diagnostics and effective treatment are very challenging, and the emergence of drug resistance has further complicated the management of these mycobacterial diseases. Various lineages of these mycobacterial pathogens show varying phenotypes in terms of clinical presentations and treatment outcomes. Altogether these factors make it further difficult to understand the full genetic diversity and pathogenicity of these pathogens using the conventional genomic and proteomic approaches. However, thanks to the recent technological advances in the genomics and proteomics field, many of these constraints have been suitably addressed. While it is relatively simpler to produce the omics data in a high-throughput manner, the bottleneck now is the pace to assimilate this large data into some useful information to reach a relevant, meaningful conclusion in a timely manner to assist the clinician in making a judgment. In India, genetic diversity of different strains has been widely studied using approaches based on Next-generation sequencing (NGS), metagenomics, spoligotyping, and PCR. But there are still gaps in predicting phenotypes accurately from genotypic data, in particular for certain drugs. Recently, Machine learning (ML) methods were successfully used to develop predictive classification models and to identify compounds based on their biological activities. Artificial Intelligence- (AI) based ML learns from known data characteristics and makes predictions. Machine learning approaches can find statistical dependencies in the data and also take into account the non-linear and feature-interaction effects. In this way, new knowledge can be unleashed and data has been proven to be useful that can provide clinically actionable recommendations and high priority features like mutation/variant/polymorphism profile and its association with the drug as well as drug resistance profile, genotype information regarding clustering and molecular epidemiology of mycobacteria. Moreover, the data utilized by the model for prediction can also be implied in rapid diagnostics and transmission dynamics studies. In this chapter, we gathered the current information about the use of Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) and NGS in mycobacterial disease and a machine learning literature supporting applications for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing in mycobacteria. We have attempted to provide a comprehensive introduction about the technological advancements in high throughput data and explain how NGS with ML can be used in clinical decision-making, genomics, proteomics, docking, simulations, drug screening, and drug-repurposing. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.",Artificial intelligence (AI); Genome-wide association study (GWAS); Leprosy; Machine learning (ML); Next generation sequencing (NGS); Tuberculosis (TB),,Use of Artificial Intelligence in Research and Clinical Decision Making for Combating Mycobacterial Diseases,NO

To tackle such life-threatening diseases, it is vital to evaluate the risk of transmission. Of critical importance in this task is the estimation of vector species populations in an area of interest. Traditional approaches to estimating vector populations involve physically collecting vector samples in traps and manually classifying species, which is highly labor intensive. A promising alternative approach is to classify mosquito species based on the audio signal from their wingbeats. Various traditional machine learning and deep learning models have been developed for such automated acoustic mosquito species classification. But they require data preprocessing and significant computation, limiting their suitability to be deployed on low-cost sensor devices. This paper presents two lightweight deep learning models for mosquito species and sex classification from wingbeat audio signals which are suitable to be deployed on small IoT sensor devices. One model is a 1D CNN and the other combines the 1D CNN with an LSTM model. The models operate directly on a low-sample-rate raw audio signal and thus require no signal preprocessing. Both models achieve a classification accuracy of over 93% on a dataset of recordings of males and females of five species. In addition, we explore the relation between model size and classification accuracy.

The convolution neural network (CNN) models can theoretically classify the malaria infected blood cells from normal cells, but they are vulnerable to network attacks even with simple uniform noise. A typical drawback of CNN is that the algorithm cannot properly capture the meaningful patterns with clinical significance. We propose a novel adaptive cycle-consistent adversarial network (Ad Cycle GAN) to synthesize malaria significant patterns based on a homogeneous image template with randomness. The Ad Cycle GAN model consists of a pretrained convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and conventional cycle-consistent adversarial network (Cycle GAN). The CVAE model is trained by a large, segmented blood cell dataset with 27,578 images. The model is optimized for 120 epochs. The CVAE is pipelined to a conventional Cycle GAN model with two generator-discriminator combinations. The real malaria positive images are at first sent to the pretrained CVAE to generate template images for the adversarial optimization with the real images. Therefore, the optimization process is to use generator G to convert the CVAE generated images from the synthetic domain (X) to the real malaria positive image domain (Y), then use generator F to convert the real malaria positive images from the real positive image domain (Y) to the CVAE synthetic image domain (X). The total generator loss is composed of adversarial loss, cycle loss, and identity loss, all loss terms are computed by least squared loss. The Ad Cycle GAN architecture is optimized by 150 epochs. When using a pretrained classifier to differentiate the real and synthetic malaria positive image, 99.61% of the real images from the real image set are accurately recognized, compared to 86.6% of the synthetic images are accurately classified. The average score of Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of the generated images by the Ad Cycle GAN is 0.0053 (Std=0.0004). By human eye observation, the Ad Cycle GAN generated images have reasonable fidelity as real blood cells with meaningful pathological patterns that properly mimics real malaria infected blood cells. The proposed Ad Cycle model can generate synthetic malaria infected blood cell images to successfully optimize the deep neural network model for high classification accuracy. We conclude that the new Ad Cycle GAN model can generate high quality malaria infected blood cell images with good diversity.  © 2021 IEEE.",Ad Cycle GAN; deep neural network; image augmentation; image synthesis; malaria,"National Institutes of Health, NIH; U.S. National Library of Medicine, NLM; Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, LHNCBC; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC",Adaptive Cycle-consistent Adversarial Network for Malaria Blood Cell Image Synthetization,YES

Artificial intelligence could automate this task making the diagnosis more accessible.

This form of covert communication is called steganography. As images are also used for training machine learning algorithms for medical diagnosis, it is important to evaluate if embedded data within images have adverse effects on the performance of medical machine learning models. This paper evaluates the effect of a previously developed steganographic algorithm called the C_{4}S algorithm on deep machine learning models for malaria diagnosis. The steganographic algorithm is used to hide patient data in malaria blood smear images. Both original and watermarked images are used to train different models using deep learning algorithms. The goal is to determine the effect of steganography on deep machine learning algorithms. The deep learning models are used to predict if a blood smear image has a malaria parasite or not. The results show that the basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained with combined watermarked and non-watermarked images has the best prediction accuracy of 97.85%. Basic CNN trained with only non-watermarked medical images performed better on the watermarked test set with an accuracy of 97.65% as opposed to lower performance on a non-watermarked test set at 94.50%accuracy.

Two predominant types of Plasmodium parasites are Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) and Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum). Diagnosis of malaria typically involves visual microscopy examination of blood smears for malaria parasites. This is a tedious, error-prone visual inspection task requiring microscopy expertise which is often lacking in resource-poor settings. To address these problems, attempts have been made in recent years to automate malaria diagnosis using machine learning approaches. Several challenges need to be met for a machine learning approach to be successful in malaria diagnosis. Microscopy images acquired at different sites often vary in color, contrast, and consistency caused by different smear preparation and staining methods. Moreover, touching and overlapping cells complicate the red blood cell detection process, which can lead to inaccurate blood cell counts and thus incorrect parasitemia calculations. In this work, we propose a red blood cell detection and extraction framework to enable processing and analysis of single cells for follow-up processes like counting infected cells or identifying parasite species in thin blood smears. This framework consists of two modules: a cell detection module and a cell extraction module. The cell detection module trains a modified Channel-wise Feature Pyramid Network for Medicine (CFPNet-M) deep learning network that takes the green channel of the image and the color-deconvolution processed image as inputs, and learns a truncated distance transform image of cell annotations. CFPNet-M is chosen due to its low resource requirements, while the distance transform allows achieving more accurate cell counts for dense cells. Once the cells are detected by the network, the cell extraction module is used to extract single cells from the original image and count the number of cells. Our preliminary results based on 193 patients (including 148 P. Falciparum infected patients, and 45 uninfected patients) show that our framework achieves cell count accuracy of 92.2%.  © 2021 IEEE.",image analysis; machine learning; Malaria diagnosis; microscopy; Plas-modium vivax; Plasmodium falciparum; thin blood smear,"National Institutes of Health, NIH; U.S. National Library of Medicine, NLM; Wellcome Trust, WT",Deep Learning-Based Cell Detection and Extraction in Thin Blood Smears for Malaria Diagnosis,YES

Outbreaks of dengue fever can be prevented by taking measures in the initial stages. In countries with high disease incidence, it requires early diagnosis of dengue.

This treatment is significantly based on recording the observation of signs and symptoms related to CHIKV in patients before prescribing medication. However, this disease can be misdiagnosed as its signs are similar to diseases like dengue or zika. This, in turn, gives rise to an uncertain diagnosis of Chikungunya. In addition, it is necessary to develop a system that will not only ensure the accurate assessment of Chikungunya but diagnose it within its early stages of infection. Since expert systems are adequate for handling uncertain data as well as generating more precise and accurate inferences, it is applied to this research.

Malaria death cases can be reduced and prevented through early diagnosis and prompt treatment. A fast and easy-to-use method, with high performance is required to differentiate malaria from non-malarial fevers. Manual examination of blood smears is currently the gold standard, but it is time-consuming, labour-intensive, requires skilled microscopists and the sensitivity of the method depends heavily on the skills of the microscopist. Currently, microscopy-based diagnosis remains the most widely used approach for malaria diagnosis. The development of automated malaria detection techniques is still a field of interest. Automated detection is faster and high accuracy compared to the traditional technique using microscopy. This paper presents an exhaustive review of these studies and suggests a direction for future developments of the malaria detection techniques.

Artificial intelligence concepts machine learning and deep learning can be applied to automate the process of disease identification and diagnosis. The paper proposes the system named “Medicare” that operates in two parts. The first module allows the user to predict the potential diseases by providing the likely symptoms. The module works on the concept of machine learning. We feed the dataset comprises of various diseases and associated symptoms pairs. Both doctors and normal people can make use of this disease predictor. Doctors can use this to verify their diagnosis results with the outcome of the system. Normal people can use this to diagnose the disease at home. The system depicts the potential diseases with their probabilities and advises them whether to consult the doctors or not. The second module allows us to test whether a medical image is positive or negative.

2020.0,diagnosis,"Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology Mesra, Patna Campus, 800014, India","On December 30, 2019, the WHO China office was informed of a pneumonia-like disease with unknown etiology, from the Wuhan city of China. This disease was found to be caused by a new type of coronavirus. The virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) and the disease caused by it was named as COVID-19. On March 11, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The testing for COVID-19 disease can be broadly classified into two main techniques, firstly, by testing the patient’s blood for immunoassays and second by PCR. The above two techniques are quite costly. Due to this, large-scale testing in developing countries like India is not practically possible. The novel coronavirus is highly infectious, and it spreads from one person to another even before the symptoms have appeared. So, the early detection of the virus will be a great way to stop this global pandemic from causing any more devastation and controlling its spread. In this paper, we review the role of technologies like artificial intelligence and deep learning in early detection, diagnosis, analysis (cure), and socio-economic impact of COVID-19. The purpose of this review paper is to provide a concise but judicious source of information to look over all the possible solutions. Technologies used: Artificial neural networks—Artificial neural networks are based on human brain and nervous system. An artificial neural network consists of several neurons and an activation function. ANNs have been used in diagnosis and early detection of several diseases like dengue and pneumonia. The same can be done in the case of COVID-19 by training the algorithm with suitable datasets. Deep Learning—Deep learning is a subclass of machine learning consisting of algorithms that are based on artificial neural networks. Deep learning is a very efficient way to handle large amount of data. Python libraries like Tensorflow are used in Linux-based systems for executing deep learning algorithms. Visualization of the Pandemic Several dashboards emerged gradually providing a global overview of the pandemic. Some of these are Upcode and NextStrain. Technologies like Python, Excel, R, and Tableau are used here for extracting data and visualizing them in the form of graphs and tables for the general public to understand. Early Detection and Diagnosis Artificial neural networks and deep learning can be used for early detection and diagnosis of the disease. The X-rays and CT images of the patients can be used as datasets. As of now the number of patients of COVID-19 in the world has increased to more than half a million, thus the dataset for training the neural networks and algorithms is quite large. This situation can be capitalized to make highly accurate neural networks using deep learning algorithms. The data can be extracted from press releases on the Internet and government databases by Web scraping. Libraries like Tensorflow can be used in training the models. Tracking and Prediction Artificial intelligence can be used to track and predict the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. We will try to throw some light on the past works in the area of epidemic prediction using AI. In 2015, neural networks were made for prediction of the Zika virus pandemic. These neural networks need to be trained again in accordance with the datasets of COVID-19. For example, Carnegie Mellon University algorithms used for predicting seasonal flu are being retrained with the datasets of COVID-19. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",Artificial intelligence; Artificial neural network; AutoML; Chest X-ray; Coronavirus; COVID-19; CT images; Data visualization; Deep learning; Pneumonia,,A review on use of data science for visualization and prediction of the covid-19 pandemic and early diagnosis of covid-19 using machine learning models,NO

In severe cases, people infected with dengue may experience severe bleeding which may lead to death if the infection is not properly treated. It is a standard procedure when a person is referred to the hospital with a high fever for more than two days to be required to undergo a dengue fever screening at the triage before further clinical tests are done to confirm the patient's medical condition. Thus, an individual need to conduct an early self-diagnosis to identify the probability that he/she have been infected with dengue fever and further seek professional help from medical practitioners. There are many dengue fever symptoms outlined by the World Health Organization (WHO) such as sudden high fever, headache, abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, rapid breathing, bleeding gums, fatigue, restlessness, and vomiting blood, but the identification of the highly significant symptoms among the less significant symptoms are still scarce. Identification of significant symptoms from the dengue dataset may help patients and medical practitioners to acknowledge the alarming symptoms and endeavour for immediate action to prevent dengue outbreak and fatality. Hence, the identification of significant dengue symptoms may assist in system development to determine the weightage of each attribute in the system. This may result in better prediction of dengue. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop an early self-diagnosis system using an artificial neural network with the ability to produce a reliable result based on the identification of significant symptoms. The model accuracy of 100% indicates the high reliability of the developed early self-diagnosis system. A mobile application was developed based on the prediction model for patients and medical practitioners as the target users. This study contributes to the field of public health by providing early detection for people who are at risk of being infected by dengue disease. The advancement in early detection technology brings such a huge positive impact in healthcare.

To obtain the accurate forecasting of DF cases, it is crucial to model the long-term dependency in time series data, which is difficult for a typical machine learning method. This study aimed to develop a timely accurate forecasting model of dengue based on long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks while only considering monthly dengue cases and climate factors. The performance of LSTM models was compared with the other previously published models when predicting DF cases one month into the future. Our results showed that the LSTM model reduced the average the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions by 12.99% to 24.91% and reduced the average RMSE of the predictions in the outbreak period by 15.09% to 26.82% as compared with other candidate models. The LSTM model achieved superior performance in predicting dengue cases as compared with other previously published forecasting models. Moreover, transfer learning (TL) can improve the generalization ability of the model in areas with fewer dengue incidences.

Microscopic examination of peripheral blood smears by experts helps to identify parasites precisely. The manual assessment technique is a tedious and time-consuming process. The present study focuses on developing a hybrid screening algorithm for automated identification and classification of malaria parasite-infected red blood cells (RBCs). Initially, a semantic blood cell segmentation method is adopted where a supervised classifier-regulated pixel-based segmentation is adopted to segment individual RBC present in an image. In pixel-based classification, foreground (RBCs) and background regions are considered, a pixel-based large feature dataset is generated, and an artificial neural network (ANN) classifier is trained. The trained model generates a probability map of an image which is later post-processed by Graph-cut and Marker-controlled Watershed method for developing cropped RBC image set. The proposed segmentation method achieves 99.1% accuracy. Finally, a trained modified Capsule Network (CapsNet) model is used for classification of segmented blood cells to identify the species and stages of the parasites. Here, two specific parasite species viz., Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum with stages are considered for classification.

Methods: Four hundred and eighty patients, who presented with acute fever requiring admission to a tertiary care teaching hospital in south India, were prospectively studied. All patients were evaluated with a detailed history, physical examination, laboratory and imaging studies. Baseline serum PCT was measured for each patient within six hours of admission. Results: Among patients with single infectious cause (n=275), significantly higher median serum PCT levels were evident in bacteraemia compared to leptospirosis (P=0.002), dengue (P <0.001), scrub typhus (P <0.001) and evident focus of infection without bacteraemia (P=0.036). By receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis, at a cut-off value of >3.2 ng/ml, the sensitivity and specificity of serum PCT levels in predicting bacteraemia were 81.1 and 63.3 per cent, respectively. As per the worst-case scenario analysis, 91 (18.9%) patients had a poor outcome and these had significantly higher median serum PCT levels compared to survivors (n=389) [9.46 (2.03-44.4) vs. 1.23 (0.34-7.645); P <0.001].

Treatment of the disease is often expensive and complicated, sometimes requiring exten-sive surgery. Ultrasonographic imaging is currently the main technique for diagnosis, while immunological analysis provides additional information. Confirmation still needs pathological analysis. However, these diagnostic techniques generally detect infection in late stages of the disease. An accurate, early and non-invasive molecular diagnostic method is still unavailable. Methodology/Principal findings We sequenced the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from plasma of echinococcosis patients and confirmed the presence of Echinococcus DNA. To improve detection sensitivity, we developed a method based on targeted next-generation sequencing of repeat regions. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the targeted sequencing is sensitive enough to detect as little as 0.1% of an Echinococcus genome in 1 mL of plasma. Results obtained using patient plasma shows that the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the method is 0.862, with a detection sensitivity of 62.50% and specificity of 100%, corresponding to a Youden-index of 0.625.

The objective of this study was to examine the epidemiology of dengue and determine the seasonal pattern of dengue and its associate to climate factors in Bangkok, Thailand, from 2003 to 2017. Methods: The dengue cases in Bangkok were collected monthly during the study period. The time-series data were extracted into the trend, seasonal, and random components using the seasonal decomposition procedure based on loess. The Spearman correlation analysis and artificial neuron network (ANN) were used to determine the association between climate variables (humidity, temperature, and rainfall) and dengue cases in Bangkok. Results: The seasonal-decomposition procedure showed that the seasonal component was weaker than the trend component for dengue cases during the study period. The Spearman correlation analysis showed that rainfall and humidity played a role in dengue transmission with correlation efficiency equal to 0.396 and 0.388, respectively. ANN showed that precipitation was the most crucial factor. The time series multivariate Poisson regression model revealed that increasing 1% of rainfall corresponded to an increase of 3.3% in the dengue cases in Bangkok. There were three models employed to forecast the dengue case, multivariate Poisson regression, ANN, and ARIMA.

However, an ion channel found only in invertebrates offers the potential of a completely new paradigm in which an established drug target can be re-engineered to serve as a new candidate therapeutic agent. The L-glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls) of invertebrates are absent from vertebrate genomes, offering the opportunity to introduce this exogenous, inhibitory, L-glutamate receptor into vertebrate neuronal circuits either as a tool with which to study neural networks, or a candidate therapy. Epileptic seizures can involve L-glutamate-induced hyper-excitation and toxicity. Variant GluCls, with their inhibitory responses to L-glutamate, when engineered into human neurons, might counter the excitotoxic effects of excess L-glutamate. In reviewing recent studies on model organisms, it appears that this approach might offer a new paradigm for the development of candidate therapeutics for epilepsy. © 2020 The Authors.

Our proposed tool extracts cells, augments them by rotation, and then pastes the augmented cells back into empty spaces between existing cells. To paste augmented cells back into an image, the underlying algorithm computes a set of candidate locations that are far away from existing cells by applying a distance transform to a cell mask. Among these candidate locations, the final locations are selected by choosing the locations that are far from each other and distributed across the image to avoid cell clusters and touching cells.For evaluation, we augment 165 blood smear images from 33 patients and run tests on 800 blood smear images from 160 patients.

Malaria inducing parasites such as Plasmodium falciparum are difficult to identify and thus have a high mortality rate. For these reasons, a deep convolutional neural network algorithm is proposed in this paper to aid in accurately identifying parasitic cells from red blood smears. By using a mixture of machine learning techniques such as transfer learning, a cyclical and constant learning rate, and ensemble methods, we have developed a model capable of accurately identifying parasitic cells within red blood smears. 14 networks pretrained from the ImageNet database are retrained with the fully connected layers replaced. A cyclical and constant learning rate are used to traverse local minima in each network. The output of each trained neural network is representing a single vote that is used in the classification process. Majority voting criteria are applied in the final classification decision between the candidate malaria cells. Several experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The NIH Malaria Dataset from the National Institute of Health, a dataset of 27, 558 images formed from microscopic patches of red blood smears, is used in these experiments. The dataset is segmented into 80% training set, 10% validation set, and 10% test set. The validation set is used as the decision metric for choosing ensemble network architectures and the test set is used as the evaluation metric for each model.

Thus, the accuracy of the outbreak prediction system becomes essential. Furthermore, the factors involved in the prediction are also crucial to note. This study combines temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed, and the number of dengue cases to predict the outbreak of dengue fever. The fuzzy-logistic regression model is used based on its compatibility with the input and output characteristics. The result shows that the fuzzy-logistic regression model can produce outbreak predictions for validation data in other regions with an average performance of 79.93%. This average performance is 14.95% higher than the average accuracy of the Neural Network, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes approaches.

Successful forecasting of the initial epidemic outbreaks can decrease the incidence of the ailment and save lives, but this type of research is costly, and an erroneous result can trigger false alarms, and the trustworthiness of the warning system will be at stake. As such, biosurveillance system developers are looking for highly sensitive outbreak prediction algorithms that will minimise the number of false alarms. Using the epidemiological data such as those of rabies to forecast novel and vital directions is a significant issue of public health, and it involves the collective attention of the machine learning (ML) communities. In this study, the data are obtained from HealthData.com and utilised for the performance evaluation of the LSTM algorithm. The algorithm performance is evaluated based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Accuracy, and compared with that of the traditional algorithm– the Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. The results from this research prove that a deep learning LSTM network can predict the disease prevalence, using the rabies datasets, with a good accuracy. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by comparing with the ARIMA model. The LSTM model attains the best result with 97.10% accuracy, while the traditional ARIMA obtains 72.10%. Moreover, the LSTM model scores the lowest value of RMSE (2.04) compared with the ARIMA model which scores the highest (3.12). Through this study, it is obvious that the LSTM prediction model is an effective method for determining this viral disease, evidenced by a very low RMSE value and a high accuracy score. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA); Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM); Machine Learning (ML); Rabies Outbreak Prediction (ROP),,Rabies outbreak prediction using deep learning with long short-term memory,YES

This is very common yet challenging setting as labelled data is expensive, time consuming to collect and may require expert knowledge. The current classification go-to of deep supervised learning is unable to cope with such a problem setup. However, using semi-supervised learning, one can produce accurate classifications using a significantly reduced amount of labelled data. Therefore, semi-supervised learning is perfectly suited for medical image classification. However, there has almost been no uptake of semi-supervised methods in the medical domain. In this work, we propose an all-in-one framework for deep semi-supervised classification focusing on graph based approaches, which up to our knowledge it is the first time that an approach with minimal labels has been shown to such an unprecedented scale with medical data. We introduce the concept of hybrid models by defining a classifier as a combination between an energy-based model and a deep net. Our energy functional is built on the Dirichlet energy based on the graph p-Laplacian. Our framework includes energies based on the$$\ell _1$$ and$$\ell _2$$ norms. We then connected this energy model to a deep net to generate a much richer feature space to construct a stronger graph. Our framework can be set to be adapted to any complex dataset.

Many tools and approaches have been considered to enable the progress toward malaria vision. The use of portable smartphones and machine learning (ML) software is a promising one among them. Recently, many ML models have been proposed for malaria detection. From the interview with health workers in the field, we realized ML model should be continuously improved to provide higher accuracy and/or more capability to cover practical issues found in a real setting such as malaria mosquitoes with drug resistance. In this paper, we propose the mobile application for malaria detection which upgrades ML model on its own without depending on internet connection. Unavailability of internet connection is commonly observed in malaria epidemic countries. We also learned that ML model should be not only accurate but also resource-efficient. This motivated us to set up performance metrics for ML model. Based on the metrics, we chose the optimal ML model of Resnet-50. While most of the prior art ML models were optimized in terms of accuracy only, the optimal model of our choice satisfies both accuracy and resource efficiency. With adopting the model, we architect self-upgrading malaria-detection application and it is validated using ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) to ensure the application works in the resource-constrained setting as desired.

While the algorithms’ complexity is a reason for their increased performance, it also leads to the ‘black box’ problem, consequently decreasing trust towards AI. In this regard, “Explainable Artificial Intelligence” (XAI) allows to open that black box and to improve the degree of AI transparency. In this paper, we first discuss the theoretical impact of explainability on trust towards AI, followed by showcasing how the usage of XAI in a health-related setting can look like. More specifically, we show how XAI can be applied to understand why Computer Vision, based on deep learning, did or did not detect a disease (malaria) on image data (thin blood smear slide images). Furthermore, we investigate, how XAI can be used to compare the detection strategy of two different deep learning models often used for Computer Vision: Convolutional Neural Network and Multi-Layer Perceptron. Our empirical results show that i) the AI sometimes used questionable or irrelevant data features of an image to detect malaria (even if correctly predicted), and ii) that there may be significant discrepancies in how different deep learning models explain the same prediction.

During the epidemic, international public health officials lacked reliable predictions of the outbreak's expected geographic scale and prevalence of cases, and were therefore unable to plan and allocate surveillance resources in a timely and effective manner. Methods: In this work, we present a dynamic neural network model to predict the geographic spread of outbreaks in real time. The modeling framework is flexible in three main dimensions (i) selection of the chosen risk indicator, i.e., case counts or incidence rate; (ii) risk classification scheme, which defines the high-risk group based on a relative or absolute threshold; and (iii) prediction forecast window (1 up to 12 weeks). The proposed model can be applied dynamically throughout the course of an outbreak to identify the regions expected to be at greatest risk in the future. Results: The model is applied to the recent Zika epidemic in the Americas at a weekly temporal resolution and country spatial resolution, using epidemiological data, passenger air travel volumes, and vector habitat suitability, socioeconomic, and population data for all affected countries and territories in the Americas. The model performance is quantitatively evaluated based on the predictive accuracy of the model. We show that the model can accurately predict the geographic expansion of Zika in the Americas with the overall average accuracy remaining above 85% even for prediction windows of up to 12 weeks. Conclusions: Sensitivity analysis illustrated the model performance to be robust across a range of features. Critically, the model performed consistently well at various stages throughout the course of the outbreak, indicating its potential value at any time during an epidemic. The predictive capability was superior for shorter forecast windows and geographically isolated locations that are predominantly connected via air travel.

Materials and Methods: We curated a data set of labeled media reports (n = 8322) indicating which articles contain updates about disease activity. We trained a classifier on this data set. To validate our system, we used a held out test set and compared our articles to the World Health Organization Disease Outbreak News reports. Results: Our classifier achieved a recall and precision of 88.8% and 86.1%, respectively. The overall surveillance system detected 94% of the outbreaks identified by the WHO covered by online media (89%) and did so 43.4 (IQR: 9.5-61) days earlier on average. Discussion: We constructed a global real-time disease activity database surveilling 114 illnesses and syndromes. We must further assess our system for bias, representativeness, granularity, and accuracy.

For its diagnosis, blood smear examination is useful in clinical cases for direct identification of the parasite but in latent infection the carrier animals are difficult to screen out by conventional blood smear test. Harboring low level of parasites and showing no symptom, the carrier animals for surra can act as a source of infection. The level of parasitaemia fluctuates, especially during latent infection; moreover the antibodies which are not found early in the infection may persist even after recovery or chemotherapy. In the present study a double antibody sandwich ELISA exploring, monoclonal antibodies and hyperimmune serum, raised against recombinant variable surface glycoprotein has been developed to detect circulating trypanosome antigens. The developed antigen detection ELISA (Ag-ELISA) was evaluated using 652 blood samples collected from cattle, buffalo, equine and camel. The statistical analysis of the data showed diagnostic sensitivity and specificity at 97.4% and 96.4% respectively, with a positive-negative cut-off OD value >0.28. Furthermore, the detection limit of the assay was found to 7.15 trypanosomes per mL. The present finding revealed that the developed assay can be exploited as a potential diagnostic test in the detection of circulating trypanosome antigens and also can be used as a population screening test for multiple animal species for detection of active infection for further treatment and control of the disease. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Antigen ELISA; Circulating antigens; Monoclonal antibody; Trypanosoma evansi; VSG,"Department of Biotechnology, Government of West Bengal, DBT-WB, (BT/PR3478/ADV/90/122/2011)",Development of an antigen ELISA using monoclonal antibodies against recombinant VSG for the detection of active infections of Trypanosoma evansi in animals,NO

The disease affects 6–8 million people, mostly in Latin America countries, and kills more people in the region each year than any other parasite-born disease, including malaria. Moreover, patient numbers are currently increasing in non-endemic, developed countries, such as Australia, Japan, Canada, and the United States. The treatment is limited to one drug, benznidazole, which is only effective in the acute phase of the disease and is very toxic. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new, safer, and effective drugs against the chronic phase of Chagas disease. Using a QSAR-based virtual screening followed by in vitro experimental evaluation, we report herein the identification of novel potent and selective hits against T. cruzi intracellular stage. We developed and validated binary QSAR models for prediction of anti-trypanosomal activity and cytotoxicity against mammalian cells using the best practices for QSAR modeling. These models were then used for virtual screening of a commercial database, leading to the identification of 39 virtual hits. Further in vitro assays showed that seven compounds were potent against intracellular T. cruzi at submicromolar concentrations (EC50 < 1 μM) and were very selective (SI > 30). Furthermore, other six compounds were also inside the hit criteria for Chagas disease, which presented activity at low micromolar concentrations (EC50 < 10 μM) against intracellular T. cruzi and were also selective (SI > 15). Moreover, we performed a multi-parameter analysis for the comparison of tested compounds regarding their balance between potency, selectivity, and predicted ADMET properties. In the next studies, the most promising compounds will be submitted to additional in vitro and in vivo assays in acute model of Chagas disease, and can be further optimized for the development of new promising drug candidates against this important yet neglected disease. © 2018",AATNXLRILQHNNJ-UHFFFAOYSA-N; ADMET; ADURSCIXNLSVQS-UHFFFAOYSA-N; AOKMDMGBLJTZGR-UHFFFAOYSA-N; BYOLMMOSOOWSCY-UHFFFAOYSA-N; Chagas disease; CXTFKBZEJHZYLK-UHFFFAOYSA-N; DDVVNKRYLQKSGG-UHFFFAOYSA-N; DRTFDDDOEPZMBV-UHFFFAOYSA-N; DXFMQYJFEFGUOP-UHFFFAOYSA-N; FPGVBDJFGIPBOP-UHFFFAOYSA-N; GEKWYGVEXDUQMM-YBFXNURJSA-N; GVDVCLSVHXYYLI-UHFFFAOYSA-N; GZLOHJDOCVFGGT-UHFFFAOYSA-N; HFGPYNFXBGMMSA-UHFFFAOYSA-N; High content screening; HRXHGCHJYURSOR-UHFFFAOYSA-N; HTCCIUHRGFQLQN-UHFFFAOYSA-N; IDFBBTXKWWRWRE-UHFFFAOYSA-N; IFKWKGQLVLTMRK-UHFFFAOYSA-N; INFUOHFIFLJRQU-UHFFFAOYSA-N; JGTKOGPGZTZRHR-UHFFFAOYSA-N; JJCWPJGSCGYDJY-UHFFFAOYSA-N; KCFFGQZFWUERFK-UHFFFAOYSA-N; MNTNUJRSUUCIQU-UHFFFAOYSA-N; NOYMFFNOKLQSBC-UHFFFAOYSA-N; OMGYDFJDQNSOID-UHFFFAOYSA-N; PVNVQDOMOBPOJT-UHFFFAOYSA-N; QSAR; QSIMVHYUETVKLU-UHFFFAOYSA-N; RFAFVASFJZRVSO-UHFFFAOYSA-N; RWVBBRPYWDKZHZ-UHFFFAOYSA-N; SQRZBVGHYBLYAV-UHFFFAOYSA-N; SYSNWVRIFFGJMH-IYLWIWFWSA-N; TWQKFBMUPUVCBS-UHFFFAOYSA-N; Validated hits; Virtual screening; WYPKEYYHHGXWMF-UHFFFAOYSA-N; XIHFGQFLZWWLPW-UHFFFAOYSA-N; XOPJDZYCKZQCOE-UHFFFAOYSA-N; YDUBFYIHZUAMSD-UHFFFAOYSA-N; YWJZRAHEPABBHR-UHFFFAOYSA-N; YZFKPFBMODFUJJ-UHFFFAOYSA-N; ZSGOAOORBZJWLL-UHFFFAOYSA-N; ZWIWAKSDZPSANW-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"UNESCO International Rising Talents; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (1U01CA207160, R01-GM114015); National Institutes of Health, NIH; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Goiás, FAPEG",Discovery of new potent hits against intracellular Trypanosoma cruzi by QSAR-based virtual screening,YES

In this work, we present a spatiotemporal analysis applied for the evaluation and planning of Chagas vector control strategies. We analysed the spatial distribution of the vector Triatoma infestans infestation related to ongoing control interventions cycles in rural communities near Añatuya, Santiago del Estero, Argentina. A geographical information system was developed for the spatial analysis obtaining, for each house, variables that describe the history of spraying and infestation at each time of interventions. Bi-dimensional histograms were used to describe the spatiotemporal pattern of these activities and peri-domestic infestation at the last intervention was modelled by a neural network model. We qualitatively evaluate control programmes considering the history of infestation and spraying from a spatiotemporal point of view, incorporating new ways of visualising this information. Predictions are based on novel, non-linear models and spatiotemporal indices, which should be useful for strategical-.; ly allocating Chagas control resources in the future and thus help to better plan spraying strategies. © the Author(s), 2019 Licensee PAGEPress, Italy.",Argentina; Chagas vector control; Geographical information systems; Neural network model; Spatiotemporal analysis,National Ministry of Health,Evaluation and planning of chagas control activities using geospatial tools,YES

Methods: Parasitological surveys were conducted from 2013 to 2015, among 19,250 children aged 8–14 years randomly sampled in 385 units (schools/villages) across all districts. Urine and stool samples were examined using parasite-egg filtration for urine samples and the Kato-Katz technique for stool specimens. Results: Human schistosome eggs from two major species (S. haematobium and S. mansoni) were detected in the surveyed population with variable prevalence and parasite intensity. Urinary schistosomiasis due to S. haematobium was widely distributed and detected in 76/77 districts with a national average prevalence of 17.56% (95 °CI:16.80%– 18.32%), compared to S. mansoni detected in 28/77 districts with a national prevalence of 2.45% (95 °CI:2.14%–2.76%). The combined national prevalence of schistosomiasis, defined by infections with either or both schistosome species was 19.78% (95% CI:18.90% –20.49%), and was detected in 76/77 districts. Based on our findings, 31 districts were classified as low-risk (>0% and <10%); 37 as moderate-risk (≥10% and <50%); and 8 as high-risk (≥50%) of schistosome infection. No infection was detected in Kpomassè district in this study. In several districts where the two species were endemic with prevalence ≥10%, S. haematobium was the most prevalent schistosome species. Boys were relatively more infected than girls (18.29% v 16.82%, p = 0.007). Of note, heavy infections with S. haematobium (>50 eggs/10 mL) were detected in several districts of Atacora, Donga, Borgou, Collines, Ouémé and Atlantique departments. Conclusions: The schistosomiasis mapping reported here clearly present a nationwide view of the epidemiological pattern of Schistosoma infections and the baseline data for implementing an effective control strategy by preventive chemotherapy (PCT). Although PCT might not be required in 32/77 districts, a yearly and bi-annual deworming is needed in 2 and 43 districts, respectively. If no environmental change occurs, and no mass treatment is delivered, prevalence is likely to remain stable for many years owing to poor hygiene and sanitation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Benin; Neglected tropical diseases; S. haematobium; S. mansoni; Schistosomiasis; West Africa,"Division of Intramural Research; National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID; United States Agency for International Development, USAID",Human schistosomiasis in Benin: Countrywide evidence of Schistosoma haematobium predominance,NO

Infection with Necator americanus (hookworm) is traditionally diagnosed by the Kato-Katz method which is inherently tedious, subjective and known to underestimate infection intensity. This study aimed to assess levels of serum ECP in relation to hookworm infection intensity. Methods Stool samples from 984 (aged 4 to 80 years) participants in a cross-sectional study conducted in the Kintampo North Municipality of Ghana were examined using the Kato-Katz and formol-ether concentration methods. Serum ECP levels were measured by ECP assay kit and compared between 40 individuals infected with hookworm only, 63 with hookworm- Plasmodium falciparum co-infection, 59 with P. falciparum infection and 36 with no infection. Results Hookworm infection prevalence was 18.1% (178/984). ECP levels were significantly higher in individuals infected with hookworm only (β = 2.96, 95%CI = 2.69, 3.23, p<0.001) or coinfected with P. falciparum (β = 3.15, 95%CI = 2.91, 3.39, p<0.001) compared to the negative control. Levels of ECP were similar between those with only P. falciparum infection and the uninfected control (p>0.05). Increased hookworm intensity was associated with a significant increase in ECP level (β = 4.45, 95%CI = 2.25, 9.11, rs = 0.193, n = 103, p<0.01). ECP threshold of 84.98ng/ml was associated with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 98% (95% CI = 92, 100), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 76% (95% CI = 62, 87) in classifying hookworm infection status with an AUROC of 96.3%.Conclusion Serum ECP level may be a good biomarker of hookworm infection and intensity and warrant further investigations to help improve current hookworm diagnosis. © 2019 Amoani et al.

Presented in this work is the modelled serological and parasitological prevalence of LF prior to the scale-up of mass drug administration (MDA) in Nigeria using a machine learning based approach. Methods: LF prevalence data generated by the Nigeria Lymphatic Filariasis Control Programme during country-wide mapping surveys conducted between 2000 and 2013 were used to build the models. The dataset comprised of 1103 community-level surveys based on the detection of filarial antigenemia using rapid immunochromatographic card tests (ICT) and 184 prevalence surveys testing for the presence of microfilaria (Mf) in blood. Using a suite of climate and environmental continuous gridded variables and compiled site-level prevalence data, a quantile regression forest (QRF) model was fitted for both antigenemia and microfilaraemia LF prevalence. Model predictions were projected across a continuous 5 × 5 km gridded map of Nigeria. The number of individuals potentially infected by LF prior to MDA interventions was subsequently estimated. Results: Maps presented predict a heterogeneous distribution of LF antigenemia and microfilaraemia in Nigeria. The North-Central, North-West, and South-East regions displayed the highest predicted LF seroprevalence, whereas predicted Mf prevalence was highest in the southern regions. Overall, 8.7 million and 3.3 million infections were predicted for ICT and Mf, respectively.

Objectives To determine the prevalence and factors associated with renal dysfunction among children with SCD aged 6 months to 12 years attended at a tertiary hospital in Northwestern Tanzania. Methods A cross sectional hospital-based study with a short follow up component of 3 months for 153 children with SCD was done to document demographics, clinical characteristics and features of renal dysfunction including urine dipstick albuminuria (>20mg/l) and eGFR (<60ml/ ml/min/1.73m2). Other potential renal insults such as HIV infection and Schistosomiasis were also evaluated. Results At enrollment, 48/153(31.37%) children had renal dysfunction declining to 31(20.3%) at 3 months follow up. Acute chest syndrome (OR 3.04, 95% CI [1.08–8.96], p = 0.044), severe anemia (OR 0.44, 95% CI [0.26–0.76],p = 0.003), urinary schistosomiasis (OR 7.43, 95% CI [2.10–26.32] p<0.002) and acute malnutrition (OR 4.92, 95% CI [1.29–18.84], p = 0.020). were associated with renal dysfunction.

Many recent dengue fever outbreaks in China have been caused solely by the vector. Mapping of the potential distribution ranges of Ae. albopictus is crucial for epidemic preparedness and the monitoring of vector populations for disease control. Climate is a key factor influencing the distribution of the species. Despite field studies indicating seasonal population variations, very little modeling work has been done to analyze how environmental conditions influence the seasonality of Ae. albopictus. The aim of the present study was to develop a model based on available observations, climatic and environmental data, and machine learning methods for the prediction of the potential seasonal ranges of Ae. albopictus in China. Methods: We collected comprehensive up-to-date surveillance data in China, particularly records from the northern distribution margin of Ae. albopictus. All records were assigned long-term (1970-2000) climatic data averages based on the WorldClim 2.0 data set. Machine learning regression tree models were developed using a 10-fold cross-validation method to predict the potential seasonal (or monthly) distribution ranges of Ae. albopictus in China at high resolution based on environmental conditions. The models were assessed based on sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, using area under curve (AUC). WorldClim 2.0 and climatic and environmental data were used to produce environmental conduciveness (probability) prediction surfaces. Predicted probabilities were generated based on the averages of the 10 models. Results: During 1998-2017, Ae. albopictus was observed at 200 out of the 242 localities surveyed. In addition, at least 15 new Ae. albopictus occurrence sites lay outside the potential ranges that have been predicted using models previously. The average accuracy was 98.4% (97.1-99.5%), and the average AUC was 99.1% (95.6-99.9%). The predicted Ae. albopictus distribution in winter (December-February) was limited to a small subtropical-tropical area of China, and Ae. albopictus was predicted to occur in northern China only during the short summer season (usually June-September). The predicted distribution areas in summer could reach northeastern China bordering Russia and the eastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in southwestern China. Ae. albopictus could remain active in expansive areas from central to southern China in October and November. Conclusions: Climate and environmental conditions are key factors influencing the seasonal distribution of Ae. albopictus in China. The areas predicted to potentially host Ae. albopictus seasonally in the present study could reach northeastern China and the eastern slope of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Our results present new evidence and suggest the expansion of systematic vector population monitoring activities and regular re-assessment of epidemic risk potential. © 2019 The Author(s).",Aedes albopictus; China; Climate; Distribution; Environment; Northern margin,,Seasonality modeling of the distribution of Aedes albopictus in China based on climatic and environmental suitability,YES

The aim of this study is to determine if variations in timing of vaccine administration and serology determination, age and gender have an influence on the levels of rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) after ID rabies vaccination. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study based on electronic health record vaccination data of Belgian military personnel who received ID rabies PrEP with a three injections regimen during the period 2014-2017. Serology was determined by using the RFFIT method. Fischer's exacts tests were used to evaluate the effect of each independent variable on RVNA levels. Results: In this study, 2,112 subjects were included. All but one seroconverted with a RVNA level ≥0.5 IU/mL. About 48% of subjects developed an antibody titer of >10 IU/mL, 36% had antibody levels 3-10 IU/mL and 16% had an antibody level 0.5-2.99 IU/mL. Statistically significant (p = 0.0018) higher RVNA levels are observed in the groups that received vaccination doses later as planned.

To address this we have produced and calibrated two African lineage ZIKV reference materials: a highly concentrated secondary standard (NIBSC: 16/110) and a lower concentration external quality control (QC) reagent (NIBSC: 16/124) and compared their performance in three ZIKV NAT assays in relation with the First International Standard (IS) for Zika Virus NAT assays (PEI: 11468/16). In summary the African lineage ZIKV reference materials were detected by all three assays. The ZIKV lineage did not affect the performance of the secondary standard. The external QC reagent (16/124) was detected by all three assays highlighting its suitability for use as a low positive control to monitor assay performance on a regular basis.

Such public health emergencies stemming from infectious disease outbreaks is creating a serious threat to global health security. For example, climate change and extreme weather events threaten to alter and affect geographic areas pertaining to disease vulnerability, such as greater risks of mosquito-borne diseases (dengue, malaria, yellow fever and Zika). The emergence of these disease outbreaks and their influence globally has sparked a renewed attention on global health security. In the Chatham House report ‘Preparing for High Impact, Low Probability Events’, Lee et al (2012:vii) ‘found that governments and businesses remain unprepared for such events’. Recent outbreaks characterize the ‘new normal’ and has unveiled major deficiencies in preparedness, response and recovery initiatives.

Deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have seen success in the existing literature. However, CNNs are computationally expensive and require significant amounts of training data, which may limit their real-world viability, especially in poorer and rural communities. Non-deep supervised techniques are largely free from these limitations but have received less attention in the existing literature. This paper differs from existing work using non-deep systems by investigating the use of RFs, adopting a more rigourous testing methodology and conducting a broader exploration of pre-processing techniques. Two non-deep supervised systems are proposed, based on random forests (RFs) and support vector machines (SVMs). The RF system performs better, having achieved an accuracy of 96.29% when tested on 20 000 images, with runtimes of less than two seconds. Testing on a small dataset of images gathered from a different source achieves similar performance, suggesting the model may generalise to different imaging conditions.

2019.0,diagnosis,"UC San Diego, United States; Microsoft Research","Advancements in deep learning enable cloud servers to provide inference-as-a-service for clients. In this scenario, clients send their raw data to the server to run the deep learning model and send back the results. One standing challenge in this setting is to ensure the privacy of the clients' sensitive data. Oblivious inference is the task of running the neural network on the client's input without disclosing the input or the result to the server. This paper introduces XONN (pronounced /z2n/), a novel end-to-end framework based on Yao's Garbled Circuits (GC) protocol, that provides a paradigm shift in the conceptual and practical realization of oblivious inference. In XONN, the costly matrix-multiplication operations of the deep learning model are replaced with XNOR operations that are essentially free in GC. We further provide a novel algorithm that customizes the neural network such that the runtime of the GC protocol is minimized without sacrificing the inference accuracy. We design a user-friendly high-level API for XONN, allowing expression of the deep learning model architecture in an unprecedented level of abstraction. We further provide a compiler to translate the model description from high-level Python (i.e., Keras) to that of XONN. Extensive proof-of-concept evaluation on various neural network architectures demonstrates that XONN outperforms prior art such as Gazelle (USENIX Security'18) by up to 7×, MiniONN (ACM CCS'17) by 93×, and SecureML (IEEE S&P'17) by 37×. State-of-the-art frameworks require one round of interaction between the client and the server for each layer of the neural network, whereas, XONN requires a constant round of interactions for any number of layers in the model. XONN is first to perform oblivious inference on Fitnet architectures with up to 21 layers, suggesting a new level of scalability compared with state-of-the-art. Moreover, we evaluate XONN on four datasets to perform privacy-preserving medical diagnosis. The datasets include breast cancer, diabetes, liver disease, and Malaria. © 2019 by The USENIX Association. All rights reserved.",,,Xonn: XNOR-based oblivious deep neural network inference,YES

Aegypti and A. Albopictus) in Latin America plays a crucial role in the fight against the Zika Virus (ZIKV). They aid in the identification of sites that promotes mosquito breeding and transmission of ZIKV. In the case of Brazil, one of the greatest factors that favours rapid mosquito reproduction is the presence of stagnated water in the environment. This could be in the form of non-flowing water filled in tanks, barrels, discarded tires, and many other containers situated in human dwellings. After the ZIKV outbreak from 2015, the environmental agency in Brazil have intensively been engaged with routine surveillance of water bodies present in households and the environment to destroy mosquito breeding hotspots as public health measure to prevent vector-to-human transmission of ZIKV. The objective of this study is to use data from their routine surveillance to showcase how our predictive framework based on Neural Networks and Online Extreme Learning Machine (OELM) can predict for Recife (Brazil) at a health district-level the following: firstly, the spatial distribution of the number of properties with water containers contaminated with the Aedes mosquito larvae responsible for ZIKV; and secondly, the spatial distribution of properties with the Aedes mosquito larvae stratified by type of water container. The ultimate goal for this research is to subsequently implement these models to their real-time surveillance data so as an early warning system is present to identify spatially the mosquito hotspots and provide an early warning.

2018.0,diagnosis,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, KLEF, Guntur, Vaddeswaram, India","The Malaria is one of the vector borne disease which effects the entire world population for a long time. Many people are affected by Malaria disease due to rampant changes in environmental and food habits. This disease is prevalent in most of the non-urban areas and people in these regions are badly affected by this disease. Dataset related to vector borne disease is usually a skewed database and accurate prediction of minority samples is very important especially in medical domain for diagnosing the vector borne diseases. Methods: The researchers have collected 165 patient’s data with and without Malaria disease from a private clinic and among them 87 are neonatal patients. The data gathered was a skewed distribution of data where the majority (negative) samples dominate minority (positive) samples. The dataset consists of 5 positive and 160 negative examples. Developing a trained model with a skewed database and producing results with minority examples with accuracy is one of the challenging issues and needs to be given high importance in current research. So, in this proposed research, the researchers have used Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) algorithm to balance the dataset with positive and negative examples. The dataset after applying the SMOTE test was then used for training and testing various classifiers like Decision tree using C4.5, Naive Bayesian and Radial Basis Function Network and then conducted a prospective comparison study of these classifiers. Results: To obtain balanced class distribution, SMOTE is applied on a given 165 patient’s data and then performed a comparative study on a range of classifiers for better classification of affected patients. Experimental results present classification accuracy for the classifier C4.5 with Decision Tree as 92.7%, Naive Bayesian with 94.7% and 98.9% for RBF Network. It shows that, RBF Network performed well over other classifiers taking into cognizance of the imbalanced dataset after applying the SMOTE test. Conclusion: In the era of medical diagnosis, machine learning algorithms play a vital role for developing a model for classification of malaria disease data. Dealing with imbalanced datasets, and prediction of the disease with those datasets is an issue of concern in many cases. In this research, the researcher has developed three models and compared the prediction accuracy of these models. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

While the standard of care includes drug combinations, there is a pressing need to identify new combinations that can bypass current resistance mechanisms. In the work presented here, a combined transcriptional drug repositioning/discovery and machine learning approach is proposed. Methods: The integrated approach utilizes gene expression data from patient-derived samples, in combination with large-scale anti-malarial combination screening data, to predict synergistic compound combinations for three Plasmodium falciparum strains (3D7, DD2 and HB3). Both single compounds and combinations predicted to be active were prospectively tested in experiment. Results: One of the predicted single agents, apicidin, was active with the AC50 values of 74.9, 84.1 and 74.9 nM in 3D7, DD2 and HB3 P. falciparum strains while its maximal safe plasma concentration in human is 547.6 ± 136.6 nM. Apicidin at the safe dose of 500 nM kills on average 97% of the parasite. The synergy prediction algorithm exhibited overall precision and recall of 83.5 and 65.1% for mild-to-strong, 48.8 and 75.5% for moderate-to-strong and 12.0 and 62.7% for strong synergies. Some of the prospectively predicted combinations, such as tacrolimus-hydroxyzine and raloxifene-thioridazine, exhibited significant synergy across the three P. falciparum strains included in the study. Conclusions: Systematic approaches can play an important role in accelerating discovering novel combinational therapies for malaria as it enables selecting novel synergistic compound pairs in a more informed and cost-effective manner. © 2018 The Author(s).",Compound combination modelling; Machine learning; Malaria; Synergistic anti-malaria compound combinations; Synergy prediction; Transcriptional drug repositioning,"European Research Council; ERC Starting, (2013); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (336159)",A systematic and prospectively validated approach for identifying synergistic drug combinations against malaria,YES

The gold sensor was functionalised with anti-pLDH after cleaning the electrode surface to remove impurities (120 °C, 1 h). The sensor was then treated to block unreacted groups on the surface and minimise matrix interference, before applying it in a sandwich assay to detect pLDH in buffer samples using a dose concentration assay. The sensor was optimised to achieve the best detection sensitivity before using it for pLDH detection in serum samples. The developed sensor achieved a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.80 ng mL−1 and 0.70 ng mL−1 for the detection of pLDH in buffer and in serum samples respectively. The sensor sensitivity was enhanced further with the use of AuNP conjugated to the detection anti-pLDH-enzyme, achieving an LOD of 19 pg mL−1 in buffer and 23 pg mL−1 in serum samples. The performance of the sensor was compared to commercially available Plasmodium immunochromatographic (ICT) malaria kits. The developed sensor was able to detect pLDH in the Dd2luc culture medium supernatant at 0.002% parasitaemia without the use of AuNP signal enhancement when compared to the OptiMAL-IT ICT kit (detect pLDH) and the BinaxNOW ICT kit (detection of both pLDH and PfHRP 2) samples. Therefore, the sensor developed in this work is highly sensitive and can be used for pLDH detection for on-site diagnosis of malaria.

Objectives: The study aims were to evaluate 1) the contribution of AI and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) to newborn iron endowment, 2) hepcidin as a biomarker to distinguish AI from IDA among pregnant women, and 3) risk factors for specific etiologies of maternal anemia. Methods: We measured hematologic biomarkers in maternal blood at 12 and 32 wk of gestation and in cord blood from a randomized trial of praziquantel in 358 pregnant women with Schistosoma japonicum in The Philippines. IDA was defined as anemia with serum ferritin <30 ng/mL and non-IDA (NIDA), largely due to AI, as anemia with ferritin ≥30 ng/mL. We identified cutoffs for biomarkers to distinguish IDA from NIDA by using area under the curve (AUC) analyses and examined the impact of different causes of anemia on newborn iron status (primary outcome) by using multivariate regression modeling. Results: Of the 358 mothers, 38% (n = 136) had IDA and 9% (n = 32) had NIDA at 32 wk of gestation. At 32 wk of gestation, serum hepcidin performed better than soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) in identifying women with NIDA compared with the rest of the cohort (AUCs: 0.75 and 0.70, respectively) and in identifying women with NIDA among women with anemia (0.73 and 0.72, respectively). The cutoff that optimally distinguished women with NIDA from women with IDA in our cohort was 6.1 μg/L. Maternal IDA, but not NIDA, was associated with significantly lower newborn ferritin (114.4 ng/mL compared with 148.4 μg/L; P = 0.042). Conclusions: Hepcidin performed better than sTfR in identifying pregnant women with NIDA, but its cost may limit its use.

This study applied artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict dengue fever outbreak occurrences in San Juan, Puerto Rico (USA), and in several coastal municipalities of the state of Yucatan, Mexico, based on specific thresholds. The models were trained with 19 years of dengue fever data for Puerto Rico and six years for Mexico. Environmental and demographic data included in the predictive models were sea surface temperature (SST), precipitation, air temperature (i.e., minimum, maximum, and average), humidity, previous dengue cases, and population size. Two models were applied for each study area. One predicted dengue incidence rates based on population at risk (i.e., numbers of people younger than 24 years), and the other on the size of the vulnerable population (i.e., number of people younger than five years and older than 65 years). The predictive power was above 70% for all four model runs. The ANNs were able to successfully model dengue fever outbreak occurrences in both study areas. The variables with the most influence on predicting dengue fever outbreak occurrences for San Juan, Puerto Rico, included population size, previous dengue cases, maximum air temperature, and date. In Yucatan, Mexico, the most important variables were population size, previous dengue cases, minimum air temperature, and date.

The global incidence of dengue has significantly increased in the last few years. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there exist 390 million dengue fever cases worldwide. In India, the number of cases of dengue was doubled during 2014 and 2015. Different geographical regions possess different levels of dengue outbreak risk depending on the meteorological, socioeconomic and lifestyle parameters such as cleanliness around the house, water storage practice, use of mosquito repellent, family history etc. Hence, a geospatial categorization helps in exercising timely prevention mechanism by the public health service personnel before the real outbreak occurs. METHODS: The presented work attempts to classify the dengue outbreak risk of the given geographical region using Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM). In this research study, medical experts contributed to construct the FCM model for assessing dengue risk. This model was trained using data-driven nonlinear Hebbian learning (DD-NHL) algorithm for 71 data samples collected from suburban areas of Chennai city, one of the tropical regions of Southern India. The new contribution of this research work is the application of the FCM methodology with its Hebb-based learning capabilities in the specific application case study. The proposed FCM model classifies the dengue outbreak risk of the given region into three categories, namely high, moderate and low. RESULTS: A large number of experiments were conducted with diverse configurations and different learning parameters of Hebb-based learning algorithms, as well as with different architectures of artificial neural networks (mainly for comparison purposes). Through the comparative analysis, also the standard machine learning based classifiers such as Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Naive Bayesian classifier, etc. were used. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of the proposed FCM-based classification approach is much better than the benchmark machine learning algorithms, which show deficiency working with small datasets and without be able to use experts' knowledge.

The Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy trial demonstrated that fluid resuscitation, involving children with severe malaria, was associated with increased mortality, primarily due to cardiovascular collapse, suggesting that myocardial dysfunction may have a role. The aim of this study was to characterize cardiac function in children with severe malaria. Design: A prospective observational study with clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic data collected at presentation (T0) and 24 hours (T1) in children with severe malaria. Cardiac index and ejection fraction were calculated at T0 and T1. Cardiac troponin I and brain natriuretic peptide were measured at T0. We compared clinical and echocardiographic variables in children with and without severe malarial anemia (hemoglobin < 5 mg/dL) at T0 and T1. Setting: Mbale Regional Referral Hospital. Patients: Children 3 months to 12 years old with severe falciparum malaria. Interventions: Usual care. Measurements and Main Results: We enrolled 104 children, median age 23.3 months, including 61 children with severe malarial anemia. Cardiac troponin I levels were elevated (> 0.1 ng/mL) in n equals to 50, (48%), and median brain natriuretic peptide was within normal range (69.1 pg/mL; interquartile range, 48.4-90.8). At T0, median Cardiac index was significantly higher in the severe malarial anemia versus nonsevere malarial anemia group (6.89 vs 5.28 L/min/m                             2                             ) (p = 0.001), which normalized in both groups at T1 (5.60 vs 5.13 L/min/m                             2                             ) (p = 0.452). Cardiac index negatively correlated with hemoglobin, r equals to -0.380 (p < 0.001). Four patients (3.8%) had evidence of depressed cardiac systolic function (ejection fraction < 45%). Overall, six children died, none developed pulmonary edema, biventricular failure, or required diuretic treatment. Conclusions: Elevation of cardiac index, due to increased stroke volume, in severe malaria is a physiologic response to circulatory compromise and correlates with anemia. Following whole blood transfusion and antimalarial therapy, cardiac index in severe malarial anemia returns to normal. The majority (> 96%) of children with severe malaria have preserved myocardial systolic function.

Because its clinical manifestations aren’t specific, the diagnosis of trichinellosis is not easy to be made. Trichinella spiralis muscle larva (ML) excretory–secretory (ES) antigens are the most widely applied diagnostic antigens for human trichinellosis, but the major drawback of the ES antigens for assaying anti-Trichinella antibodies is the false negative in the early Trichinella infection period. The aim of this study was to characterize the T. spiralis putative serine protease (TsSP) and to investigate its potential use for diagnosis of trichinellosis. Methodology/Principal findings: The full-length TsSP sequence was cloned and expressed, and recombinant TsSP (rTsSP) was purified by Ni-NTA-Sefinose Column. On Western blotting analysis the rTsSP was recognized by T. spiralis-infected mouse serum, and the natural TsSP was identified in T. spiralis ML crude and ES antigens by using anti-rTsSP serum. Expression of TsSP was detected at various T. spiralis developmental stages (newborn larvae, muscle larvae, intestinal infective larvae and adult worms). Immunolocalization identified the TsSP principally in cuticles and stichosomes of the nematode. The sensitivity of rTsSP-ELISA and ES-ELISA was 98.11% (52/53) and 88.68% (47/53) respectively (P > 0.05) when the sera from trichinellosis patients were examined. However, while twenty-one serum samples of trichinellosis patients’ sera at 19 days post-infection (dpi) were tested, the sensitivity (95.24%) of rTsSP-ELISA was distinctly higher than 71.43% of ES-ELISA (P < 0.05). The specificity (99.53%) of rTsSP-ELISA was remarkably higher than 91.98% of ES-ELISA (P < 0.01). Only one out of 20 serum samples of cysticercosis patients cross-reacted with the rTsSP. Specific anti-Trichinella IgG in infected mice was first detected by rTsSP-ELISA as soon as 7 dpi and antibody positive rate reached 100% on 10 dpi, whereas the ES-ELISA did not permit detection of 100% of infected mice before 16 dpi.

Irreversible fibrosis results from the progress of the schistosomal hepatopathy. Sensitive diagnosis of this disease is based on the investigation of the microscopy images, liver tissues, and egg identification. Early diagnosis of schistosomiasis at its initial infection stage is vital to avoid egg-induced irreparable pathological reactions. Typically, there are several classification approaches that can be used for liver fibrosis staging. However, it is unclear which approaches can achieve high accuracy for analyzing and intelligently classifying the liver microscopic images. Consequently, this work aims to study the performance of the different machine learning classifiers for accurate fibrosis level staging of granuloma, namely cellular, fibrocellular and fibrotic granulomas as well as the normal samples. The classifiers include a multi-layer perceptron neural network, a decision tree, discriminant analysis, support vector machine (SVM), nearest neighbor, and the ensemble of classifiers. The statistical features of the microscopic images are extracted from the different fibrosis levels of granuloma, namely cellular, fibrocellular and fibrotic granulomas as well as the normal samples. The results established that the maximum achieved classification accuracies of value 90% were achieved using the subspace discriminant ensemble, the quadratic SVM, the linear SVM, or the linear discriminant classifiers.

For the detection, a custom designed convolutional neural network (CNN) operating on focus stack of images is used. The cell counting problem is addressed as the segmentation problem and we propose a 2-level segmentation strategy. Use of CNN operating on focus stack for the detection of malaria is first of its kind, and it not only improved the detection accuracy (both in terms of sensitivity [97.06%] and specificity [98.50%]) but also favored the processing on cell patches and avoided the need for hand-engineered features. The slide images are acquired with a custom-built portable slide scanner made from low-cost, off-the-shelf components and is suitable for point-of-care diagnostics. The proposed approach of employing sophisticated algorithmic processing together with inexpensive instrumentation can potentially benefit clinicians to enable malaria diagnosis. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2018.0,diagnosis,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, PSG College of Technology, Coimbatore, India","Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bite of female anopheles mosquito. Malaria is usually found in tropical and subtropical climates where the parasites that cause it live. Once the parasite enters the human body, it lodges itself in the liver where it multiplies approximately 10,000 times. The diagnosis of malaria is done by various methods which include thick and thin smear method, rapid diagnostic test, antigen detection etc. The limitations of these methods includes false positive rate. This paper presents a methodology to identify the malarial parasites so that the false positive rate is reduced. The color based discrimination is one of the most feasible methods as it shows greater accuracy and efficiency. The K-means clustering technique is followed for color based discrimination. The segmented malarial cell from K-means clustering is further subjected to morphological operations to extract the feature for classification. The results show that the proposed method helps in the detection of infected red blood cells thus improving decision-making for malaria diagnosis. © RJPT All right reserved.",Color based discrimination; False positive rate; K-means clustering; Malaria; Morphological operation,,Detection of malarial parasites using image processing techniques from blood smear slides,YES

Unusual variations in color, shape and size of blood cells indicate abnormal condition. We used a total of 117 images from Leishman stained peripheral blood smears acquired at a magnification of 100X. In this paper we present a robust image processing algorithm for detection of nuclei and classification of white blood cells based on features of the nuclei. We used novel image enhancement method to manage illumination variations and TissueQuant method to manage color variations for the detection of nuclei. Dice similarity coefficient of 0.95 was obtained for nucleus detection. We also compared the proposed method with a state-of-the-art method and the proposed method was found to be better. Shape and texture features of the detected nuclei were used for classifying white blood cells. We considered classification of WBCs using two approaches such as 5-class and cell-by-cell approaches using neural network and hybrid-classifier respectively. We compared the results of both the approaches for classification of white blood cells. Cell-by-cell approach offered 1.4% higher sensitivity in comparison with the 5-class approach. We obtained an accuracy of 100% for lymphocyte and basophil detection. Hence, we conclude that lymphocytes and basophils can be accurately detected even when the analysis is limited to the features of nuclei whereas, accurate detection of other types of WBCs will require analysis of the cytoplasm too. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Computer aided detection; Nuclei detection; Peripheral blood smear images; WBC classification,,Development of a Robust Algorithm for Detection of Nuclei and Classification of White Blood Cells in Peripheral Blood Smear Images,YES

To assess the fibrosis level for diagnosis and treatment, the microscopic images of the liver tissues were examined at their different stages. In the present work, an automated staging method is proposed to classify the statistical extracted features from each fibrosis stage using an ensemble classifier, namely the subspace ensemble using linear discriminant learning scheme. The performance of the subspace/discriminant ensemble classifier was compared to other ensemble combinations, namely the boosted/trees ensemble, bagged/trees ensemble, subspace/KNN ensemble, and the RUSBoosted/trees ensemble.

In this paper, we develop a computer-assisted malaria-infected life-cycle stages classification based on a hybrid classifier using thin blood smear images. The major issues are: feature extraction, feature selection and classification of erythrocytes infected with different life-cycle stages of malaria. Feature set (134 dimensional features) has been defined by the combination of the proposed features along with the existing features. Features such as prediction error, co-occurrence of linear binary pattern, chrominance channel histogram, R–G color channel difference histogram and Gabor features are the newly proposed features in our system. In the feature selection, a two-stage algorithm utilizing the filter method to rank the feature, along with the incremental feature selection technique, has been analyzed. Moreover, the performance of all the individual classifiers (Naive Bayes, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors and artificial neural network) is evaluated. Finally, the three individual classifiers are combined to develop a hybrid classifier using different classifier combining techniques. From the experimental results, it may be concluded that hybrid classifier formed by the combination of SVM, k-NN and ANN with majority voting technique provides satisfactory results compared to other individual classifiers as well as other hybrid model. An accuracy of 96.54 ± 0.73% has been achieved on the collected clinical database.

One of the serious parasitic diseases affecting the liver tissues is schistosomiasis. Immunologic reactions to Schistosoma eggs leads to accumulation of collagen in the hepatic parenchyma causing fibrosis. Thus, monitoring and reporting the staging of the histopathological information related to liver fibrosis are essential for accurate diagnosis and therapy of the chronic liver diseases. Automated assessment of the microscopic liver tissue images is an essential process. For accurate and timeless assessment, an automated image analysis and classification of different stages of fibrosis can be employed as an efficient procedure. In this work, granuloma stages, namely cellular, fibrocellular, and fibrotic granulomas along with normal liver samples were classified after features extraction. In this work, a new hybrid combination of statistical features with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is proposed. These combined features are further classified using the back-propagation neural network (BPNN). A comparative study of the used classifier with the support vector machine is also conducted. The comparative results established that the BPNN achieved superior accuracy of 98.3% compared to the linear SVM, quadratic SVM, and cubic SVM that provided 85%, 84%, and 80%; respectively.

Breaking news of the Zika outbreak for instance, made it to the main media titles internationally. Perceiving disease risks motivate people to adapt their behavior toward a safer and more protective lifestyle. Computational science is instrumental in exploring patterns of disease spread emerging from many individual decisions and interactions among agents and their environment by means of agent-based models. Yet, current disease models rarely consider simulating dynamics in risk perception and its impact on the adaptive protective behavior. Social sciences offer insights into individual risk perception and corresponding protective actions, while machine learning provides algorithms and methods to capture these learning processes. This article presents an innovative approach to extend agent-based disease models by capturing behavioral aspects of decision-making in a risky context using machine learning techniques. We illustrate it with a case of cholera in Kumasi, Ghana, accounting for spatial and social risk factors that affect intelligent behavior and corresponding disease incidents. The results of computational experiments comparing intelligent with zero-intelligent representations of agents in a spatial disease agent-based model are discussed. Methods: We present a spatial disease agent-based model (ABM) with agents' behavior grounded in Protection Motivation Theory. Spatial and temporal patterns of disease diffusion among zero-intelligent agents are compared to those produced by a population of intelligent agents. Two Bayesian Networks (BNs) designed and coded using R and are further integrated with the NetLogo-based Cholera ABM. The first is a one-tier BN1 (only risk perception), the second is a two-tier BN2 (risk and coping behavior). Results: We run three experiments (zero-intelligent agents, BN1 intelligence and BN2 intelligence) and report the results per experiment in terms of several macro metrics of interest: an epidemic curve, a risk perception curve, and a distribution of different types of coping strategies over time. Conclusions: Our results emphasize the importance of integrating behavioral aspects of decision making under risk into spatial disease ABMs using machine learning algorithms. This is especially relevant when studying cumulative impacts of behavioral changes and possible intervention strategies. © 2018 The Author(s).",Bayesian networks; Cholera; Disease diffusion; Emergent behavior; Learning; Protection motivation theory,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO, (640‑006‑012); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO",Intelligent judgements over health risks in a spatial agent-based model,YES

It was estimated that 5–6 years of treatment would be sufficient to eliminate the disease. Tremendous progress has been made over the years, and treatment has stopped in many disease endemic districts. However, despite the successful implementation of MDA, there are districts with persistent transmission. In this study we assessed the epidemiology of LF in three adjoining districts that have received at least 16 years of MDA. The assessments were undertaken one year after the last MDA. 1234 adults and 182 children below the age of 10 years were assessed. The overall prevalence of circulating filarial antigen in the study participants was 8.3% (95% CI: 6.9–9.9), with an estimated microfilaria prevalence of 1.2%. The microfilarial intensity in positive individuals ranged from 1 to 57 microfilariae/mL of blood. Higher antigen prevalence was detected in males (13.0%; 95% CI: 10.3–16.2) compared to females (5.5%; 95% CI: 4.1–7.2). The presence of infection was also highest in individuals involved in outdoor commercial activities, with the risks of infection being four- to five-fold higher among farmers, fishermen, drivers and artisans, compared to all other occupations. Using bednets or participating in MDA did not significantly influence the risk of infection. No children below the age of 10 years were found with infection. Detection of Wb123 antibodies for current infections indicated a prevalence of 14.4% (95% CI: 8.1–23.0) in antigen-positive individuals above 10 years of age.

One of the most common nutritional problems in adolescent girl is anemia. This risk of anemia increases especially for those living in endemic area of malaria. The relationship between nutritional status and malaria is complex and involves many determinant factors. Objective: This study aims to determine the relationship between anemia and nutritional status in adolescent girl in West Sulawesi Province. Material and Method: This study was a cross-sectional and conducted in North Mamuju Regency, West Sulawesi Province. A total of 200 adolescent girls as the subjects from 4 schools were selected using two stage random sampling. The variables measured were malaria status, type of malaria, worm status, and nutritional status. Diagnosis of malaria is conducted by health professional based on the result of blood sample analysis (250-500 ml). The type of malaria was observed in the sub-sample (43 students). Nutritional status was calculated after measurement of body weight and height by using weight for height indices (WHZ score). Feces collected are to see the presence of worm infection. Bivariate and multivariate analyzes were performed using chi-square, t-test, and ANOVA analysis using SPSS 15. Result: This study shows that most respondents have decent dwellings. It is characterized by 71.5% having own latrines, 60% having cemented wells, cemented floor (62.5%), and 73.5% tin roofs. This study also shows that the number of malaria was 21.5% and the dominant type of malaria was Tertiana (79.1%). Many of adolescent girls were malnutrition marked by BMI <17 kg/m2, chronic energi deficiency, and anemia (9.5%, 54.5%, 71.9%, respectively). In addition, 28.5% of students were infected with the worms. Bivariate analysis showed that there was no significant association between malaria status and anemia (p = 0.368). However, it appears that those with malaria have lower mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) than non-malaria. Similarly with the indicator of body mass index, adolescent girl with malaria had lower BMI than non-malaria (19.05 kg/ m2 vs. 19.39 kg/ m2). However, hemoglobin levels in the malaria group were higher than the non-malaria group (11.34 vs. 11.05). Conclusion: The current study concluded that malaria in adolescent girl may have an impact on body composition but not on hemoglobin levels.

Previous transcriptomic studies have been performed to elucidate altered pathways in response to viral infection. However, the intrinsic coupling between alimentation and infection were unappreciated in these studies. Feeding is required for the initial mosquito contact with the virus and these events are highly dependent. Addressing this relationship, we reinterrogated datasets of virus-infected mosquitoes with two different diet schemes (fed and unfed mosquitoes), evaluating the metabolic cross-talk during both processes. We constructed coexpression networks with the differentially expressed genes of these comparison: virus-infected versus blood-fed mosquitoes and virus-infected versus unfed mosquitoes. Our analysis identified one module with 110 genes that correlated with infection status (representing ~0.7% of the A. aegypti genome). Furthermore, we performed a machine-learning approach and summarized the infection status using only four genes (AAEL012128, AAEL014210, AAEL002477, and AAEL005350). While three of the four genes were annotated as hypothetical proteins, AAEL012128 gene is a membrane amino acid transporter correlated with viral envelope binding. This gene alone is able to discriminate all infected samples and thus should have a key role to discriminate viral infection in the A. aegypti mosquito. Moreover, validation using external datasets found this gene as differentially expressed in four transcriptomic experiments. Therefore, these genes may serve as a proxy of viral infection in the mosquito and the others 106 identified genes provides a framework to future studies. © 2018 Fukutani, Kasprzykowski, Paschoal, Gomes, Barral, de Oliveira, Ramos and Queiroz.",Aedes aegypti; Alimentation; Blood-feeding; Meta-analysis; Transcriptomics; Vector-borne diseases; Virus infection,,Meta-analysis of Aedes aegypti expression datasets: Comparing virus infection and blood-fed transcriptomes to identify markers of virus presence,YES

Accurate noninvasive measures of BV are needed for optimal clinical trial design. Our objectives were to examine the performance of six different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) BV quantification measures for predicting mortality in PCM and to review the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Methods: Receiver operator characteristics were generated from BV measures of MRIs of children admitted to an ongoing research project with PCM between 2009 and 2014. Fatal cases were matched to the next available survivor. A total of 78 MRIs of children aged 5 months to 13 years (mean 4.0 years), of which 45% were males, were included. Results: Areas under the curve (AUC) with 95% confidence interval on measures from the initial MRIs were: Radiologist-derived score = 0.69 (0.58-0.79; P = 0.0037); prepontine cistern anteroposterior (AP) dimension = 0.70 (0.56-0.78; P = 0.0133); SamKam ratio [Rt. parietal lobe height/(prepontine AP dimension + fourth ventricle AP dimension)] = 0.74 (0.63-0.83; P = 0.0002); and global cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space ascertained by ClearCanvas = 0.67 (0.55-0.77; P = 0.0137). For patients with serial MRIs (n = 37), the day 2 global CSF space AUC was 0.87 (0.71-0.96; P < 0.001) and the recovery factor (CSF volume day 2/CSF volume day 1) was 0.91 (0.76-0.98; P < 0.0001). Poor prognosis is associated with radiologist score of ≥7; prepontine cistern dimension ≤3 mm; cisternal CSF volume ≤7.5 ml; SamKam ratio ≥6.5; and recovery factor ≤0.75.

However, the relationship between β-endorphin levels in the plasma and CSF of children with cerebral malaria (CM) has not been reported. Aim: To determine the relationship between β-endorphin levels in the CSF and plasma of children with CM. Settings and Design: This cross-sectional study involved 40 children, aged between 6 months and 14 years, admitted with a diagnosis of CM at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex (OAUTHC), Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Materials and Methods: One milliliter (mL) of venous blood and 1mL of CSF obtained from each subject at admission were used to determine the β-endorphin levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Statistical Analysis: Bivariate linear regression was used to determine the association between plasma and CSF β-endorphin levels using the correlation coefficient (r), coefficient of determination (R2), and P values. Results: The plasma β-endorphin levels significantly positively correlated with CSF β-endorphin (r < 0.568, P < 0.001) such that for every unit rise in plasma β-endorphin, CSF β-endorphin rose by 0.252 pmol/L (confidence interval: 0.132-0.371 pmol/L). Conclusion: The finding of positive correlation between plasma and CSF β-endorphin levels in this study suggests a possible direct link between plasma and CSF in CM, probably from the disruption of the blood-brain barrier that has been reported in CM. © 2019 Journal of Pediatric Neurosciences | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",cerebral malaria; cerebrospinal fluid; plasma; β-Endorphin,,Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid beta-endorphin levels show a strong association in children with cerebral malaria,NO

The diagnostic method starts by adding a blood sample to the top phase of the test tube where the anti-T. cruzi antibodies present in the blood attach to the T. cruzi antigens on the surface of the MLμBs. Shaking the test tube after incubation mixes the top layer with a paramagnetic medium loaded with SiO2 microcrystals. The attachment of SiO2 microcrystals to those MLμBs bound to T. cruzi antibodies decreases their levitation height once the tube is placed between two antialigned permanent magnets. Measuring the levitation height of MLμBs enables the accurate detection and quantification of anti-T. cruzi antibodies in the blood across the clinically relevant range, with a detection limit of 5 μg mL−1. The small size of the test tubes facilitates the simultaneous analysis of over 50 different samples. MLμBs act as partial collimators for non-polarized light, facilitating their visual identification by the naked eye or by projecting incident light on a thin paper screen. A machine-vision algorithm was created to automatically interpret the results of the MLμB tests from a digital image, resulting in a rapid, accurate, and user-friendly assay for Chagas disease that can be used in resource-limited settings. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Procter and Gamble, P&G, (209621); Procter and Gamble, P&G; Purdue University; Fundación Alfonso Martín Escudero",Portable and power-free serodiagnosis of Chagas disease using magnetic levitating microbeads,YES

It is a problem that causes harm at both individual and macro scales. The Korea Center for Disease Control (KCDC) operates a surveillance system to minimize infectious disease contagions. However, in this system, it is difficult to immediately act against infectious disease because of missing and delayed reports. Moreover, infectious disease trends are not known, which means prediction is not easy. This study predicts infectious diseases by optimizing the parameters of deep learning algorithms while considering big data including social media data. The performance of the deep neural network (DNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) learning models were compared with the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) when predicting three infectious diseases one week into the future. The results show that the DNN and LSTM models perform better than ARIMA. When predicting chickenpox, the top-10 DNN and LSTM models improved average performance by 24% and 19%, respectively. The DNN model performed stably and the LSTM model was more accurate when infectious disease was spreading. We believe that this study’s models can help eliminate reporting delays in existing surveillance systems and, therefore, minimize costs to society. © 2018 by the authors.

Little is known about pulmonary mechanics and gas exchange in less-common etiologies of ARDS, which comprises 12-23% of cases. Our hospital's ARDS quality assurance database contained a substantial number of these cases. This descriptive study examines the pulmonary mechanics, and gas exchange characteristics of this diverse cohort of ARDS subjects. Methods: Between March 2010 and April 2017 we identified 94 subjects with less common etiologies of ARDS who had dead space fraction (VD/VT) and respiratory system compliance (CRS) measured within 24 hours of ARDS onset; 86 of whom did not have sepsis as a co-diagnosis. There were 18 identifiable sources of ARDS. For descriptive purposes these were subsumed under 10 etiologic categories: pancreatitis (n=16), hemorrhagic shock/reperfusion injury (n=9), transfusion-associated acute lung injury (TRALI) (n=3), drug overdose (n=13), inhalation injury (n=10), idiopathic (n=10), neurogenic (n=8), pulmonary toxicity (n=3), hyper-immune response (n=4), hepatic failure (n=7), and 3 other cases: 2 cutaneous burns and one case of malaria. VD/VT was measured using the Enghoff-Bohr equation. Arterial blood gases were drawn simultaneously with mixed expired CO2 using volumetric capnography and standard pulmonary mechanics measurements. Data are expressed as median (IQR). Comparisons between groups used Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's post-tests, Mann-Whitney tests or Fisher exact tests. Results: The majority of less common ARDS were from indirect sources (79%) with 9% attributed to direct causes and 11% idiopathic. Because of the small sample sizes, there were no differences in pulmonary mechanics or gas exchange between subgroups classified as indirect, direct and idiopathic, or between subgroups sharing common lung injury mechanisms. Nevertheless, salient trends were apparent particularly in CRS and VD/VT. CRS was most severely reduced in the toxicity subgroup and least impaired in the idiopathic subgroup [18 (11 to 22), and 40 (30 to 43) mL/cmH2O respectively]. VD/VT was extraordinarily high in the hepatic failure subgroup and lowest in pancreatitis [0.78 (0.57 to 0.79) and 0.54 (0.47 to 0.65) respectively]. There was less distinction in oxygenation as median values for all subgroups met moderate ARDS criteria. For the entire cohort, only VD/VT was statistically different between non-survivors and survivors: 0.66 (0.57 to 0.78) vs. 0.59 (0.51 to 0.68), P=0.012. Conclusions: Within a diverse cohort having less common presentations of ARDS, there was apparent variability in the distribution of CRS, VD/VT compared to differences oxygenation dysfunction. Elevated pulmonary dead space still identified patients with higher mortality, as is the case with more common causes of ARDS. © Journal of Thoracic Disease.

In Zambia, schistosomiasis seroprevalence can reach 88% in endemic areas. Bacterial translocation (BT) drives portal hypertension in cirrhosis contributing to mortality but remains unexplored in HSS. Rifaximin, a non-absorbable antibiotic may reduce BT. We aimed to explore the influence of rifaximin on BT, inflammation, and fibrosis in HSS. In this phase II open-label trial (ISRCTN67590499), 186 patients with HSS in Zambia were evaluated and 85 were randomized to standard care with or without rifaximin for 42 days. Changes in markers of inflammation, BT, and fibrosis were the primary outcomes. BT was measured using plasma 16S rRNA, lipopolysaccharidebinding protein, and lipopolysaccharide, whereas hyaluronan was used to measure fibrosis. Tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and soluble cluster of differentiation 14 (sCD14) assessed inflammation. 16S rRNA reduced from baseline (median 146 copies/μL, interquartile range [IQR] 9, 537) to day 42 in the rifaximin group (median 63 copies/μL, IQR 12, 196), P < 0.01.

Urogenital schistosomiasis (caused by Schistosoma haematobium) increases protein and blood in urine and intestinal schistosomiasis (caused by S. mansoni) affects total body water. However, no data exist on how different schistosome species affect urine specific gravity (USG), a hydration biomarker. Therefore, we assessed the relationship between S. haematobium- and S. mansoni-infected and uninfected women and USG in rural Tanzania. Materials and methods: Surveys were conducted and stool and urine samples were collected among 211 nonpregnant women aged 18–50. S. haematobium eggs were detected using the urine filtration method. S. mansoni eggs were detected using the Kato Katz method. USG was measured using a refractometer and analyzed as both a continuous and dichotomous variable. Regression (linear/logistic) models were estimated to test the relationship between infection and hydration status. Results: The prevalence of S. haematobium was 5.9% and S. mansoni was 5.4% with no coinfections. In regression models, S. haematobium-infected women had significantly higher USG (Beta = 0.007 g mL−1; standard error = 0.002; p = 0.001) and odds (Odds ratio: 7.76, 95% CI: 1.21-49.5) of elevated USG (>1.020 g mL−1) than uninfected women, whereas S. mansoni-infected women did not. Discussion: Schistosoma haematobium, but not S. mansoni, infection is associated with higher USG and risk of inadequate hydration.

While a diversity of modeling technique have been used to create predictive models of malaria, no work has made use of Bayesian networks. Bayes nets are attractive due to their ability to represent uncertainty, model time lagged and nonlinear relations, and provide explanations. This paper explores the use of Bayesian networks to model malaria, demonstrating the approach by creating village level models with weekly temporal resolution for Tha Song Yang district in northern Thailand. The networks are learned using data on cases and environmental covariates. Three types of networks are explored: networks for numeric prediction, networks for outbreak prediction, and networks that incorporate spatial autocorrelation. Evaluation of the numeric prediction network shows that the Bayes net has prediction accuracy in terms of mean absolute error of about 1.4 cases for 1 week prediction and 1.7 cases for 6 week prediction. The network for outbreak prediction has an ROC AUC above 0.9 for all prediction horizons. Comparison of prediction accuracy of both Bayes nets against several traditional modeling approaches shows the Bayes nets to outperform the other models for longer time horizon prediction of high incidence transmission. To model spread of malaria over space, we elaborate the models with links between the village networks. This results in some very large models which would be far too laborious to build by hand. So we represent the models as collections of probability logic rules and automatically generate the networks. Evaluation of the models shows that the autocorrelation links significantly improve prediction accuracy for some villages in regions of high incidence. We conclude that spatiotemporal Bayesian networks are a highly promising modeling alternative for prediction of malaria and other vector-borne diseases. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Bayesian networks; Malaria prediction; Probability logic; Spatiotemporal models,"Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg Institute for Advanced Study; ITC-PAC, (FA5209-15-P-0183); US Army International Technology Center Pacific",Spatiotemporal Bayesian networks for malaria prediction,NO

Climatic variables has been identified as important predictors in models for infectious disease forecasts. Various approaches have been proposed in the literature to produce accurate and timely predictions and potentially improve public health response. Methods: We assessed how the machine learning LASSO method may be useful in providing useful forecasts for different pathogens in countries with different climates. Separate LASSO models were constructed for different disease/country/forecast window with different model complexity by including different sets of predictors to assess the importance of different predictors under various conditions. Results: There was a more apparent cyclicity for both climatic variables and incidence in regions further away from the equator. For most diseases, predictions made beyond 4 weeks ahead were increasingly discrepant from the actual scenario. Prediction models were more accurate in capturing the outbreak but less sensitive to predict the outbreak size. In different situations, climatic variables have different levels of importance in prediction accuracy. Conclusions: For LASSO models used for prediction, including different sets of predictors has varying effect in different situations. Short term predictions generally perform better than longer term predictions, suggesting public health agencies may need the capacity to respond at short-notice to early warnings. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Endemic infectious disease; LASSO; Real time forecast,"National University Health System, NUHS",The utility of LASSO-based models for real time forecasts of endemic infectious diseases: A cross country comparison,YES

Unfortunately, our ability to identify these viruses is limited by gaps in disease surveillance and an incomplete understanding of the process of viral adaptation. By fitting boosted regression trees to data on 224 human viruses and their associated traits, we developed a model that predicts the human transmission ability of zoonotic viruses with over 84% accuracy. This model identifies several viruses that may have an undocumented capacity for transmission between humans. Viral traits that predicted human transmissibility included infection of nonhuman primates, the absence of a lipid envelope, and detection in the human nervous system and respiratory tract. This predictive model can be used to prioritize high-risk viruses for future research and surveillance, and could inform an integrated early warning system for emerging infectious diseases. © 2018 Walker et al.

Recently, researchers have begun working on this issue and several methods have been proposed to visualize and understand the behavior of these models. We highlight the advantages offered through visualizing and understanding the weights, saliencies, class activation maps, and region of interest localizations in customized CNNs applied to the challenge of classifying parasitized and uninfected cells to aid in malaria screening.

The urine-CCA has been evaluated for detection of S. mansoni with promising results. Its specificity and consistency in detecting S. haematobium infection in different endemic regions has been variable. This study validated a rapid urine-CCA cassette test for qualitative detection of S. haematobium infection in an S. haematobium endemic area with low S. mansoni prevalence. Microscopic examination for the standard urine filtration technique was used to validate the commercially available urine-CCA cassette test (rapid medical diagnostics ®). The validation was done in a sample of primary school pupils (n = 420) aged 10–15 years in schools in the Jozini Municipality, KZN. There was a relationship between infection intensity and a positive urine-CCA test. Using the urine filtration method as the gold standard, the prevalence for S. haematobium was 40%, the accuracy of the CCA kit was 54.8%, sensitivity was 68.1% while the specificity was 45.8%. The positive predictive value was 45.82% while the negative predictive value was 68.05%. Both the urine filtration and the urine-CCA methods detected heavy (≥50 eggs/10 mL urine) and light infections at statistically significant levels. The overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the urine-CCA cassette test were low. The urine-CCA cassette test performed much better for heavy infections than low infections (p < 0.05) implying that the kit may not be suitable for low endemic areas. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Point of care diagnosis; Schistosoma haematobium; Schistosoma mansoni; Urine circulating cathodic antigens,"Canadian International Development Research Centre; UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Program for research and Training in Tropical Diseases; International Development Research Centre, IDRC; Inyuvesi Yakwazulu-Natali, UKZN",Validation of a urine circulating cathodic antigen cassette test for detection of Schistosoma haematobiumin uMkhanyakude district of South Africa,NO

Big data-driven analytics are recently facilitated on the large dataset to monitor climate-driven changes and also for the dengue outbreak prediction. Many past studies have established an association between the meteorological variables and the dengue incidence. Hence, this paper examines the effects of meteorological factors on dengue incidence in one of the climatic categories of the tropical region in Asia. The nine meteorological parameters and number of dengue cases per week were considered in this study. Subsequently, the most influencing variables of dengue incidence were selected using a new heuristic optimization algorithm such as grey wolf optimization (GWO) based on Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) followed by negative binomial regression model which was employed to evaluate various lag times between dengue incidences and meteorological variables.

In this paper, we present an initial result of an effort to develop a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) system for the diagnosis of malaria. Concepts and their causality were defined based on the experiential knowledge from 30 physicians in 3 hospitals in Nigeria, who served as knowledge sources for this study. The semantic relationships among concepts were utilized in constructing an FCM model for malaria diagnosis, which was further integrated into a decision support engine (DSE). The comparative summary showed that the initial hypotheses (IH) by the physicians correctly matched the final diagnosis in 55% of the cases, whereas the accurate diagnosis (AD) of the FCM was 85%. This result is interesting; further analysis using Kendall's taub and the Spearman's rank order test also indicated a higher (though equally significant) correlation between the FCM results and AD than between IH and AD.

In addition, fever is the main symptom of diseases such as dengue fever, typhoid fever, diarrhea, gastroenteritis, measles, pneumonia, pharyngitis, and bronchitis. These diseases have similar symptoms, causing difficulty to distinguish them. In fact, the symptoms of diseases are usually recorded in a medical record document.Medical records can be categorized in order to ease diagnosis. The technique to categorize based on certain characteristics to several classes is called classification. Classification can categorize textual data which are first converted into numerical data so that the classification process can generate results. Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor is one classification technique that measures the distance between training and testing data, which then put them into a fuzzy set. This study developed a classification system for childhood diseases with fever using Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor based on textual medical record documents.The test results of the classification system showed an accuracy of 83.3% in the dengue fever and pneumonia data with a comparison of training and testing data of 80: 20, K value of 10, and M value of 2.

Furthermore, the degree of individual-level protection conferred by elevated responses to these antigens has not yet been explored.

We find that commonly assumed immune correlates are poor predictors of clinical protection in children.

Samples are a number of preparations that have been given indications of malaria and have given a Giemsa staining. Image acquisition process is done by using a digital microscope with 1000 times of magnification. The process of segmentation used thresholding method of Otsu. Selection feature used sequential forward selection (SFS). Classification technique used artificial neural network of learning vector quantization (LVQ) with K-fold cross validation to identify patterns of types of parasites and their life stages in order to get different types and stages of malaria disease. The results used a combination of texture with morphological traits to get the values of accuracy. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.",K-Fold validation; LVQ; Malaria disease; SFS; Texture of feature extraction and morphology,,Identification of malaria disease and its stadium based on digital image processing,YES

Results: The ZIKV-5′-UTR assay exhibited the lowest in vitro limit of detection (5–10 RNA copies/reaction and 3.0 × 10−1 plaque-forming units/ml). Compared to the modified version of a widely adopted RT-PCR assay targeting the ZIKV-E gene, the ZIKV-5′-UTR assay showed better sensitivity in human clinical specimens, and representative mouse specimens, including many organs which are known to be involved in human ZIKV infection but difficult to obtain in clinical settings. The ZIKV-5′-UTR assay detected ZIKV RNA in 84/84 (100.0%) ZIKV-E'-positive and an additional 30/296 (10.1%, P < 0.01) ZIKV-E'-negative mouse specimens. The higher sensitivity of the ZIKV-5′-UTR assay was most significant in kidney and testis/epididymis specimens (P < 0.01). No in vitro or in vivo cross-reactivity was found between the ZIKV-5′-UTR assay and dengue virus, yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, hepatitis C virus and Chikungunya virus.

Methods: Male Swiss albino mice were treated with 100 and 200 μg/mL of nicotine in drinking water daily for 6 weeks followed by Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection. On the seventh day of post infection (p.i.), physical, clinical, histopathological, biochemical and hematological parameters were assessed. Data were analyzed using SPSS software. Results: Nicotine was significantly (P < 0.05) positively associated with lower levels of hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (HCT), red blood cells (RBCs), C-reactive protein (CRP) and uric acid (UA), higher risk to incidence of pulmonary edema, elevated level of liver and kidney biomarkers. Also significant increment (P < 0.01) of monocyte-lymphocyte count ratio (MLCR) was observed. Risk to high temperature, lower platelet count, high parastemia and cerebral malaria was lesser in mice treated with nicotine (100 and 200 μg/mL) followed by PbA infection than the positive control. Lack of neurological symptoms might be accounted to the anti-inflammatory property of nicotine that could inhibit production of pro-inflammatory mediators responsible for occurrence of cerebral malaria. Conclusions: This study showed that despite down regulation of most cerebral malaria symptoms nicotine was strongly associated with increased risk to most clinical symptoms of malaria. Thus, like in respiratory infections, nicotine use might enhance susceptibility to malaria. © 2017 by the Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Disease.",C-reactive protein; Cerebral malaria; Hemoglobin; Monocyte-lymphocyte count ratio; Nicotine; Plasmodium berghei ANKA,,In vivo effect of chronic nicotine exposure on outcome of Plasmodium berghei ANKA malaria,NO

With collaboration between physicians and artificial intelligence engineers, a comprehensive knowledge base relevant to jaundice was created based on demographic information, symptoms, physical signs, laboratory tests, imaging diagnosis, medical histories, and risk factors. Then a diagnostic modeling and reasoning system using the dynamic uncertain causality graph was proposed. A modularized modeling scheme was presented to reduce the complexity of model construction, providing multiple perspectives and arbitrary granularity for disease causality representations. A “chaining” inference algorithm and weighted logic operation mechanism were employed to guarantee the exactness and efficiency of diagnostic reasoning under situations of incomplete and uncertain information. Moreover, the causal interactions among diseases and symptoms intuitively demonstrated the reasoning process in a graphical manner. Verification was performed using 203 randomly pooled clinical cases, and the accuracy was 99.01% and 84.73%, respectively, with or without laboratory tests in the model. The solutions were more explicable and convincing than common methods such as Bayesian Networks, further increasing the objectivity of clinical decision-making. The promising results indicated that our model could be potentially used in intelligent diagnosis and help decrease public health expenditure. © 2017, Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Dynamic uncertain causality graph; Expert system; Intelligent diagnosis; Jaundice,,Intelligent diagnosis of jaundice with dynamic uncertain causality graph model,NO

These approaches have also proved their significance through accurate and earlier diagnosis of diseases. The objective of this work is to develop a diagnostic model for earlier diagnosis of dengue disease. Dengue fever is spread through the bite of the female mosquito (Aedes aegypti). The symptoms of this fever are similar to other fever such as that of Viral influenza, Chikungunya, Zika fever, and so on. However, in this fever, human life can be at risk due to severe depletion of blood platelets. Therefore, early diagnosis of dengue disease can help in protecting human lives by making a preventive move before it turns into an infectious disease. In this work, an effort is made to develop a PSO-ANN based diagnostic model for earlier diagnosis of dengue fever. In the proposed model, PSO technique is applied to optimize the weight and bias parameters of ANN method. Further, PSO optimized ANN approach is used to detect dengue patients. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, error rate and AUC parameters. The results of the proposed model have been compared with other existing approaches like ANN, DT, NB, and PSO.

Methods: A retrospective study was carried out using blood samples from patients with slide-confirmed infection by P. falciparum, classified according to the parasitological response after 28 days of follow-up. Quinine and doxycycline were measured in plasma samples by high-performance liquid chromatography. A statistical model was used to estimate parasite clearance rates. Results: Six of 40 patients who met the criteria for inclusion in the study showed recurrence of parasitaemia within 28 days after the commencement of treatment. A group of six patients with adequate parasitological response was formed to avoid bias when the variables were compared. Parasitaemia at admission was similar in both groups. Plasma quinine concentrations were similar in both groups on days 1, 2 and 3 and ranged from 1.07 to 4.35 μg/ml in cured patients and from 1.1 to 3.2 μg/ml in patients with parasite recurrence. Concentrations of doxycycline were similar in both groups on day 3. The parasite clearance rate constant was 0.131 ± 0.16 h in the cured patients and 0.117 ± 0.02 h in those showing recurrence. The slope half-life in the cured patients was 4.8 h and 5.4 h in recurrence cases. The hillslope of the cured group (14.24) increased sharply compared to the recurrence group (4.13).

Climate change has contributed to the problem by allowing for the survival of Anopheles in previously uninhabited areas. As such, several groups have made developing news systems for the automated diagnosis of malaria a priority. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a new, automated, mobile device-based diagnostic system for malaria. The system uses Giemsa-stained peripheral blood samples combined with light microscopy to identify the Plasmodium falciparum species in the ring stage of development. Methods: The system uses image processing and artificial intelligence techniques as well as a known face detection algorithm to identify Plasmodium parasites. The algorithm is based on integral image and haar-like features concepts, and makes use of weak classifiers with adaptive boosting learning. The search scope of the learning algorithm is reduced in the preprocessing step by removing the background around blood cells. Results: As a proof of concept experiment, the tool was used on 555 malaria-positive and 777 malaria-negative previously-made slides. The accuracy of the system was, on average, 91%, meaning that for every 100 parasite-infected samples, 91 were identified correctly. Conclusions: Accessibility barriers of low-resource countries can be addressed with low-cost diagnostic tools.

The effects of this disease are much more profound in third world countries, which have very limited medical resources. When an intense outbreak occurs, most of these countries cannot cope with the high number of patients due to the lack of medicine, equipment and hospital facilities. The prevention or reduction of the risk factor of this disease is very challenging, especially in third world countries, due to poverty and economic insatiability. Technology can offer alternative solutions by providing early detection mechanisms that help to control the spread of the disease and allow the management of treatment facilities in advance to ensure a more timely health service, which can save thousands of lives.

The system will help hospitals, healthcare providers, and health organizations take precautions in time and utilize their resources in case of emergency. To our best knowledge, the system developed in this paper is the first publicly available application. Since confounding effects of climatic factors have a greater influence on the incidence of malaria, we have also conducted extensive research on exploring a new ecosystem model for the assessment of hidden ecological factors and identified three confounding factors that significantly influence the malaria incidence.

However, it is not known whether this compound will elicit antitrypanosomal activity in in vivo condition which is usually the next step in the drug discovery process. Purpose Herein, we investigated the in vivo activity of ellagic acid against bloodstream form of Trypanosoma congolense and its ameliorative effects on trypanosome-induced anemia and organ damage as well as inhibitory effects on trypanosomal sialidase. Methods Rats were infected with T. congolense and were treated with 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight (BW) of ellagic acid for fourteen days. The levels of parasitemia, packed cell volume and biochemical parameters were measured. Subsequently, T. congolense sialidase was partially purified on DEAE cellulose column and the mode of inhibition of ellagic acid on the T. congolense sialidase determined. Molecular docking study was also conducted to determine the mode of interaction of the ellagic acid to the catalytic domain of T. rangeli sialidase. Results At a dose of 100 and 200 mg/kg (BW), ellagic acid demonstrated significant (P < 0.05) trypanosuppressive effect for most of the 24 days experimental period. Further, the ellagic acid significantly (P < 0.05) ameliorated the trypanosome-induced anemia, hepatic and renal damages as well as hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and renal hypertrophy. The trypanosome-associated free serum sialic acid upsurge alongside the accompanied membrane bound sialic acid reduction were also significantly (P < 0.05) prevented by the ellagic acid treatment. The T. congolense sialidase was purified to a fold of 6.6 with a yield of 83.8%. The enzyme had a KM and Vmax of 70.12 mg/ml and 0.04 µmol/min respectively, and was inhibited in a non-competitive pattern by ellagic acid with an inhibition binding constant of 1986.75 μM. However, in molecular docking study, ellagic acid formed hydrogen bonding interaction with major residues R39, R318, and W124 at the active site of T. rangeli sialidase with a predicted binding free energy of -25.584 kcal/mol.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the relevancy of the tweets and what people were tweeting about the 4 disease characteristics of Zika: symptoms, transmission, prevention, and treatment. Methods: A combination of natural language processing and machine learning techniques was used to determine what people were tweeting about Zika. Specifically, a two-stage classifier system was built to find relevant tweets about Zika, and then the tweets were categorized into 4 disease categories. Tweets in each disease category were then examined using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to determine the 5 main tweet topics for each disease characteristic. Results: Over 4 months, 1,234,605 tweets were collected. The number of tweets by males and females was similar (28.47% [351,453/1,234,605] and 23.02% [284,207/1,234,605], respectively). The classifier performed well on the training and test data for relevancy (F1 score=0.87 and 0.99, respectively) and disease characteristics (F1 score=0.79 and 0.90, respectively). Five topics for each category were found and discussed, with a focus on the symptoms category. Conclusions: We demonstrate how categories of discussion on Twitter about an epidemic can be discovered so that public health officials can understand specific societal concerns within the disease-specific categories. Our two-stage classifier was able to identify relevant tweets to enable more specific analysis, including the specific aspects of Zika that were being discussed as well as misinformation being expressed.

It is quite easy to get infected by these diseases, which have very similar symptoms, most of which manifest after days. Technology, today, can provide a helping hand in the correct diagnosis of these diseases. In this paper, we take up three diseases prevalent in India: malaria, dengue and chikungunya. The proposed method uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based backpropagation algorithm for training and testing.

Various parts of Asia and Latin America are affected but highest malaria incidence is found in Sub-Saharan Africa. Standard diagnosis of malaria comprises microscopic detection of parasites in stained thick and thin blood films. As the process of slide reading under the microscope is an error-prone and tedious issue we are developing computer-assisted microscopy systems to support detection and diagnosis of malaria. In this paper we focus on a deep learning (DL) approach for the detection of plasmodia and the evaluation of the proposed approach in comparison with two reference approaches. The proposed classification schemes have been evaluated with more than 180,000 automatically detected and manually classified plasmodia candidate objects from so-called thick smears. Automated solutions for the morphological analysis of malaria blood films could apply such a classifier to detect plasmodia in the highly complex image data of thick smears and thereby shortening the examination time. With such a system diagnosis of malaria infections should become a less tedious, more reliable and reproducible and thus a more objective process.

Millions of blood slides are manually screened for parasites every year, which is a tedious and error-prone process, and which largely depends on the expertise of the microscopists. We have developed a software to perform this task on a smartphone, using machine learning and image analysis methods for counting infected red blood cells automatically. The method we implemented first needs to detect and segment red blood cells. However, the presence of white blood cells (WBCs) contaminates the red blood cell detection and segmentation process because WBCs can be miscounted as red blood cells by automatic cell detection methods. As a result, a preprocessing step for WBC elimination is essential. Our paper proposes a novel method for white blood cell segmentation in microscopic images of blood smears. First, a range filtering algorithm is used to specify the location of white blood cells in the image following a Chan- Vese level-set algorithm to estimate the boundaries of each white blood cell present in the image. The proposed segmentation algorithm is systematically tested on a database of more than 1300 thin blood smear images exhibiting approximately 1350 WBCs. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method for the two WBC detection and WBC segmentation steps by comparing the annotations provided by a human expert with the results produced by the proposed algorithm.

Therefore, the development of computational models to forecast the number of cases based on available epidemiological data would benefit public surveillance health systems to take effective actions regarding the prevention and mitigation of these events. In this work, we present the application of machine learning algorithms to predict the morbidity dynamics of dengue and chikungunya in Colombia using time-series-forecasting methods. Available weekly incidence for dengue (2007–2016) and chikungunya (2014–2016) from the National Health Institute of Colombia was gathered and employed as input to generate and validate the models. Kernel Ridge Regression and Gaussian Processes were used at forecasting the number of cases of both diseases considering horizons of one and four weeks. In order to assess the performance of the algorithms, rolling-origin cross-validation was carried out, and the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE), mean absolute errors (MAE), R2 and the percentages of explained variance calculated for each model. Kernel Ridge regression with one-step ahead horizon was found to be superior to other models in forecasting both dengue and chikungunya number of cases per week.

Domestic dogs are the main peridomestic reservoir, and allopurinol is the most frequently used drug for the control of infection, alone or in combination with other drugs. Resistance of Leishmania strains from dogs to allopurinol has not been described before in clinical studies. Methodology/Principal Findings: Following our observation of clinical disease relapse in dogs under allopurinol treatment, we tested susceptibility to allopurinol of L. infantum isolated from groups of dogs pre-treatment, treated in remission, and with disease relapse during treatment. Promastigote isolates obtained from four treated relapsed dogs (TR group) showed an average half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 996 μg/mL. A significantly lower IC50 (P = 0.01) was found for isolates from ten dogs before treatment (NT group, 200 μg/mL), as well as for five isolates obtained from treated dogs in remission (TA group, 268 μg/mL). Axenic amastigotes produced from isolates of the TR group also showed significantly higher (P = 0.002) IC50 compared to the NT group (1678 and 671 μg/mL, respectively). The lower sensitivity of intracellular amastigotes from the TR group relative to those from the NT group (P = 0.002) was confirmed using an infected macrophage model (6.3% and 20% growth inhibition, respectively at 300 μg/mL allopurinol). Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate allopurinol resistance in L. infantum and to associate it with disease relapse in the canine host. These findings are of concern as allopurinol is the main drug used for long term control of the disease in dogs, and resistant L. infantum strains may enhance uncontrolled transmission to humans and to other dogs. © 2016 Yasur-Landau et al.",,,Allopurinol Resistance in Leishmania infantum from Dogs with Disease Relapse,NO

In particular, in recent years, as the number of people who enjoy outdoor activities in urban areas continues to increase, information about mosquito activity is in demand. Furthermore, mosquito activity prediction is crucial for managing the safety and the health of humans. However, the estimation of mosquito abundances frequently involves uncertainty because of high spatial and temporal variations, which hinders the accuracy of general mechanistic models of mosquito abundances. For this reason, it is necessary to develop a simpler and lighter mosquito abundance prediction model. In this study, we tested the efficacy of the artificial neural network (ANN), which is a popular empirical model, for mosquito abundance prediction. For comparison, we also developed a multiple linear regression (MLR) model. Both the ANN and the MLR models were applied to estimate mosquito abundances in 2-year observations in Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul, conducted using the Digital Mosquito Monitoring System (DMS). As input variables, we used meteorological data, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and precipitation. The results showed that performances of the ANN model and the MLR model are almost same in terms of R and root mean square error (RMSE). The ANN model was able to predict the high variability as compared to MLR. A sensitivity analysis of the ANN model showed that the relationships between input variables and mosquito abundances were well explained.

Antigen presenting cells are reported to be affected by erythrocytic stage of the parasite. Malarial hemozoin (HZ), a metabolite of malaria parasite, has adjuvant properties and may play a role in the induction of immune response against the parasite. Objective: To determine the immunological impact of hemozoin on the capacity of innate immune cells maturation. Methods: Plasmodium falciparum (F32 strain) was cultured in O+ blood group up to 18% parasitemia. Natural hemozoin was extracted from infected red blood cells. Murine bone marrow derived macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells were stimulated with 4 µg/mL or 40 µg/mL of synthetic hemozoin (β-hematin) or natural hemozoin. We assessed the immunomodulatory role of synthetic or natural hemozoin in vitro by flowcytometric analysis. Results: The maturation markers MHCII, CD80 and CD86 were significantly upregulated (p<0.05) on the surface of murine bone marrow derived macrophages or myeloid dendritic cells. Data confirmed the potential of macrophages or myeloid dendritic cells, through hemozoin activation, to establish an innate immune response against malaria parasites. Conclusion: Both synthetic and natural hemozoin are potent inducers of cellular immunity against malaria infection. However, natural hemozoin is a stronger inducer as compared to synthetic hemozoin. © 2016, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

The seroprevalence of Schistosoma mansoni is up to 77% in endemic parts of Zambia. Morbidity is attributed to portal hypertension causing variceal bleeding which can be fatal. Bacterial translocation is associated with portal hypertension in cirrhosis but this is almost unexplored in hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. Liver biopsy is usually used to assess fibrosis although it is invasive and prone to sampling error. We aimed to investigate translocation, fibrosis and inflammatory makers in a case-control study of schistosomiasis at the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia. Methods: Patients had oesophageal varices, but were negative for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C viruses. Plasma lipopolysaccharide binding protein was used as a marker of translocation while hyaluronan and laminin measured liver fibrosis. Inflammatory markers were measured in blood. Controls were patients with non-specific abdominal pain who had normal endoscopy. Results: Median (interquartile range) lipopolysaccharide binding protein was elevated in patients [44.3 ng/ml (35.7, 57.1)] compared to controls [30.7 ng/ml (30.4, 35.5), P < 0.0001]. Hyaluronan was higher in patients [111.6 ng/ml (39.1, 240.3)] compared to controls [21.0 ng/ml (12.4, 37.6), P < 0.0001] and so was laminin [2.2 lg/ml (1.0, 3.7)] compared to controls [0.9 lg/ml (0.7, 1.2), P = 0.0015]. Inflammatory markers, except C-reactive protein, were elevated in patients. Conclusions: These data suggest that the bacterial translocation contributes to systemic inflammation in hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. Elevated fibrotic markers suggest they may be useful in diagnosing and monitoring periportal fibrosis. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In spite of this, a good number of these drugs have the potential to cause harm when they are misused or abused. Objective: This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of commonly-used antimalarial drugs in the North Western region of Nigeria on haemolysis and DNA fragmentation in the blood of normal and malarial infected humans ex vivo. Method: The drugs used were artemisinine, artesunate, chloroquine, coartem and quinine (0.5-8.0 mg/ml). Haemolysis, haemoglobin status and DNA fragmentations were assayed for using standard procedures. Results: It was observed that all the drugs induced a remarkable dose-dependent haemolysis with more pronounced effects on apparently healthy humans. There was a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the level of haemoglobin in normal blood samples when compared with control samples. Contrariwise, in the malaria-infected blood, the haemoglobin level significantly (P < 0.05) increased as compared with control. The drugs caused an exceptional significant (P < 0.05) induction of DNA fragmentation when compared with control. Conclusion: Commonly-used antimalarial drugs induced haemolysis and altered haemoglobin status which may spontaneously increases the cellular iron levels; a substrate for Fenton and Haber Weiss reactions, and eventually induces DNA fragmentation. Hence, adequate care should be taken during prescription with total avoidance for self medications and/or drugs abuse as a result of their adverse effects within the red blood cells and its immediate microenvironment. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.",Antimalarial drugs; DNA damage; Haemoglobin; Haemolysis; Nigeria,,Induction of haemolysis and DNA fragmentation in a normal and malarial-infected blood by commonly - used antimalarial drugs in the north-western region of Nigeria,NO

It is a challenge for the healthcare system when demand for care suddenly surges. Traditionally, valuation of heath care spatial accessibility was based on static supply and demand information. In this study, we proposed an optimal model with the three-step floating catchment area (3SFCA) to account for the supply to minimize variability in spatial accessibility. We used empirical dengue fever outbreak data in Tainan City, Taiwan in 2015 to demonstrate the dynamic change in spatial accessibility based on the epidemic trend. The x and y coordinates of dengue-infected patients with precision loss were provided publicly by the Tainan City government, and were used as our model’s demand. The spatial accessibility of heath care during the dengue outbreak from August to October 2015 was analyzed spatially and temporally by producing accessibility maps, and conducting capacity change analysis. This study also utilized the particle swarm optimization (PSO) model to decrease the spatial variation in accessibility and shortage areas of healthcare resources as the epidemic went on. The proposed method in this study can help decision makers reallocate healthcare resources spatially when the ratios of demand and supply surge too quickly and form clusters in some locations. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Floating catchment area; Particle swarm optimization,,Minimizing spatial variability of healthcare spatial accessibility—the case of a dengue fever outbreak,NO

Initially, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed for the complexes for 10 ns using AMBER 12 software. The conformers of the complexes (75) generated from the equilibrated protein were undergone protein–ligand interaction fingerprint (PLIF) analysis. The results showed that some important residues, such as LeuB96, TrpB102, TrpB106, ArgB202, TyrB300, AspB359 and TyrB361, are predominantly present in most of the complexes for interactions. These residues form side chain acceptor and surface (hydrophobic or π–π) kind of interactions with the ligands present in the complexes. The structure-based pharmacophore models were generated from the fingerprint bits obtained from PLIF analysis. The pharmacophore models have 3–4 pharmacophore contours consist of acceptor and metal ligation (Acc & ML), hydrophobic (HydA) and extended acceptor (Acc2) features with the radius ranging between 1–3 Å for Acc & ML and 1–2 Å for HydA. The excluded volumes of the pharmacophore contours radius are between 1–2 Å. Further, the distance between the interacting groups, root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) and radial distribution function (RDF) analysis were performed for the MD-simulated proteins using PTRAJ module. The generated pharmacophore models were used to screen a set of natural compounds and database compounds to select significant HITs.

Methods: Simulations under different scenarios (the input variables are independent or in network relationship) as well as an application were conducted to assess the prediction performance of four typical methods including Bayesian network, neural network, logistic regression and regression splines. Results: The simulation results reveal that Bayesian network showed a better performance when the variables were in a network relationship or in a chain structure. For the special wheel network structure, logistic regression had a considerable performance compared to others. Further application on GWAS of leprosy show Bayesian network still outperforms other methods.

Pathogenesis of severe Plasmodium vivax malaria is poorly understood. Endothelial dysfunction and reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability characterize severe falciparum malaria, but have not been assessed in severe vivax malaria. Methods. In patients with severe vivax malaria (n = 9), patients with nonsevere vivax malaria (n = 58), and healthy controls (n = 79), we measured NO-dependent endothelial function by using reactive hyperemia-peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) and assessed associations with arginine, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), and hemolysis. Results. The L-arginine level and the L-arginine to ADMA ratio (a measure of L-arginine bioavailability) were reduced in patients with severe vivax malaria and those with nonsevere vivax malaria, compared with healthy controls (median L-arginine level, 65, 66, and 98 μmol/mL, respectively [P =. 0001]; median L-arginine to ADMA ratio, 115, 125, and 187, respectively [P =. 0001]). Endothelial function was impaired in proportion to disease severity (median RH-PAT index, 1.49, 1.73, and 1.97 in patients with severe vivax malaria, those with nonsevere vivax malaria, and healthy controls, respectively; P =. 018) and was associated with the L-arginine to ADMA ratio. While the posttreatment fall in hemoglobin level was greater in severe vivax malaria as compared to nonsevere vivax malaria (2.5 vs 1 g/dL; P =. 0001), markers of intravascular hemolysis were not higher in severe disease. Conclusions. Endothelial function is impaired in nonsevere and severe vivax malaria, is associated with reduced L-arginine bioavailability, and may contribute to microvascular pathogenesis.

Some of the deficiencies in dengue epidemiology are insufficient awareness on the parameter as well as the combination among them. Most of the studies on dengue prediction use standalone models which face problem of finding the appropriate parameter since they need to apply try and error approach. The aim of this paper is to conduct experiments for determining the best network structure that has effective variable and fitting parameters in predicting the spread of the dengue outbreak. Four model structures were designed in order to attain optimum prediction performance. The best model structure was selected as predicting model to solve the time series prediction of dengue. The result showed that neighboring location of dengue cases was very effective in predicting the dengue outbreak and it is proven that the hybrid Genetic Algorithm and Neural Network (GANN) model significantly outperforms standalone models namely regression and Neural Network (NN). © 2016 Nor Azura Husin, Norwati Mustapha, Md.

The RTS,S/AS01 malaria candidate vaccine was reviewed by the European Medicines Agency and received a positive scientific opinion; WHO subsequently recommended pilot implementation in sub-Saharan African countries. Because malaria and HIV overlap geographically, HIV-infected children should be considered for RTS,S/AS01 vaccination. We therefore aimed to assess the safety of RTS,S/AS01 in HIV-infected children at two sites in western Kenya. Methods We did a randomised, double-blind, controlled trial at the clinical trial sites of the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI)–Walter Reed Army Institute of research in Kisumu and the KEMRI/US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Siaya. Eligible participants were infants and children aged from 6 weeks to 17 months with WHO stage 1 or 2 HIV disease (documented positive by DNA PCR), whether or not they were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive three doses of either RTS,S/AS01 or rabies vaccine (both 0·5 mL per dose by intramuscular injection), given once per month at 0, 1, and 2 months. We did the treatment allocation using a web-based central randomisation system stratified by age (6 weeks–4 months, 5–17 months), and by baseline CD4% (<10, 10–14, 15–19, and ≥20). Data were obtained in an observer-blind manner, and the vaccine recipient, their parent or carer, the funder, and investigators responsible for the assessment of endpoints were all masked to treatment allocation (only staff responsible for the preparation and administration of the vaccines were aware of the assignment and these individuals played no other role in the study). We provided ART, even if the participants were not receiving ART before the study, and daily co-trimoxazole for prevention of opportunistic infections. The primary outcome was the occurrence of serious adverse events until 14 months after dose 1 of the vaccine, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01148459. Findings Between July 30, 2010, and May 24, 2013, we enrolled 200 children to our study and randomly assigned 99 to receive RTS,S/AS01 and 101 to receive rabies vaccine. 177 (89%) of the 200 children enrolled completed 14 months of follow-up. Serious adverse events were noted in 41 (41·4%, 95% CI 31·6–51·8) of 99 RTS,S/AS01 recipients and 37 (36·6%, 27·3–46·8) of 101 rabies-vaccine recipients (relative risk 1·1, 95% CI 0·8–1·6). 20 (20·2%, 95% CI 12·8–29·5) of 99 RTS,S/AS01 recipients and 12 (11·9%, 6·3–19·8) of 101 rabies-vaccine recipients had at least one serious adverse event within 30 days after vaccination, mainly pneumonia, febrile convulsions, and salmonella sepsis. Five (5·1%, 95% CI 1·7–11·4) of 99 RTS,S/AS01 recipients and four (4·0%, 1·1–9·8) of 101 rabies-vaccine recipients died, but no deaths were deemed related to vaccination. Mortality was associated with five cases of pneumonia (1% RTS,S/AS01 recipients vs 3% rabies-vaccine recipients), five cases of gastroenteritis (3% RTS,S/AS01 recipients vs 2% rabies-vaccine recipients), five cases of malnutrition (2% RTS,S/AS01 recipients vs 3% rabies-vaccine recipients), one case of sepsis (1% rabies-vaccine recipients), one case of Haemophilus influenza meningitis (1% rabies-vaccine recipients), and one case of tuberculosis (1% RTS,S/AS01 recipients). Interpretation RTS, S/AS01 was well tolerated when given to children with WHO clinical stage 1 or 2 HIV disease along with high antiretroviral and co-trimoxazole use.

Methods In 2013, in a national assessment based on 22 sentinel sites, 3514 school children aged 7–11 years were checked for Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma mansoni infection by the examination of urine and stool samples, respectively. We analysed the observed prevalence and intensity of infections and compared these with the relevant results of earlier surveys in Burkina Faso. Findings S. haematobium was detected in 287/3514 school children (adjusted prevalence: 8.76%, range across sentinel sites: 0.0–56.3%; median: 2.5%). The prevalence of S. haematobium infection was higher in the children from the Centre-Est, Est and Sahel regions than in those from Burkina Faso’s other eight regions with sentinel sites (P < 0.001). The adjusted arithmetic mean intensity of S. haematobium infection, among all children, was 6.0 eggs per 10 ml urine. Less than 1% of the children in six regions had heavy S. haematobium infections – i.e. at least 50 eggs per 10 ml urine – but such infections were detected in 8.75% (28/320) and 11.56% (37/320) of the children from the Centre-Est and Sahel regions, respectively.

However, as eggs are responsible mainly for schistosomiasis pathology, so crude soluble egg antigen (SEA) seems suitable to be used as a potential vaccine. Many studies have provided new insights establishing a role for mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in liver regeneration and improvement of schistosomiasis hepatic fibrosis, in addition to the need for standardized and effective adjuvant-vaccine formulations. So, the aim of this work is to evaluate the effect of stem cells when used as an adjuvant of a potential anti-schistosomal vaccine (crude SEA) in murine models. The current work was carried out on 100 mice (30 males for harvesting MSCs + 70 females for seven study groups, each of 10). A schedule of vaccination and challenge infection was followed so, GI (control healthy), G2 (control infected only) infected subcutaneously with S. mansoni cercaria (80-90 Schistosoma mansoni cercariae suspended in 0.2 ml distilled Water), G 3 (FCA then infected) received Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) then infected, G4 (MSCs then infected) received MSCs then infected, G5 (SEA then infected) received SEA vaccine then infected, G6 (SEA+FCA then infected) received SEA vaccine and FCA then infected, G7 (SEA+MSCs then infected) received SEA vaccine and MSCs then infected.

The current study has evaluated the trypanocidal activity of Commiphora swynnertonii extracts on Trypanosoma congolense. Methods: The effect of ethanolic stem bark and resinous extracts on motility of T. congolense was evaluated by in vitro study at concentrations of 2 mg/ml and 4 mg/ml. Then, trypanocidal activity was evaluated by drug incubation infectivity test using mice at concentrations of 0.4 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml. In both studies negative (without drug) and positive (diminazene diaceturate) controls were used. Results: The in vitro study showed that, ethanolic stem bark extract of C. swynnertonii at concentration of 4 mg/ml caused complete cessation of motility for T. congolense in 30 min. However, resinous ethanolic extract had delayed effect on cessation of motility of T. congolense observed at 90 and 100 min post-incubation at concentrations of 4 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml respectively. The drug incubation infectivity test study depicted that ethanolic stem bark extract at concentration of 2 mg/ml significantly (p = 0.000) reduced the infectivity of T. congolense in mice.

In Latin America, the diagnosis is made by microscopical detection of the T. cruzi parasite in the blood; a diagnostic test that lacks sensitivity. This study evaluates if levels of T. cruzi antigens in urine, determined by Chunap (Chagas urine nanoparticle test), are correlated with parasitemia levels in T. cruzi/HIV co-infected patients. Methodology/Principal Findings: T. cruzi antigens in urine of HIV patients (N = 55: 31 T. cruzi infected and 24 T. cruzi serology negative) were concentrated using hydrogel particles and quantified by Western Blot and a calibration curve. Reactivation of Chagas disease was defined by the observation of parasites in blood by microscopy. Parasitemia levels in patients with serology positive for Chagas disease were classified as follows: High parasitemia or reactivation of Chagas disease (detectable parasitemia by microscopy), moderate parasitemia (undetectable by microscopy but detectable by qPCR), and negative parasitemia (undetectable by microscopy and qPCR). The percentage of positive results detected by Chunap was: 100% (7/7) in cases of reactivation, 91.7% (11/12) in cases of moderate parasitemia, and 41.7% (5/12) in cases of negative parasitemia. Chunap specificity was found to be 91.7%. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a direct relationship between parasitemia levels and urine T. cruzi antigen concentrations (p<0.001). A cut-off of > 105 pg was chosen to determine patients with reactivation of Chagas disease (7/7). Antigenuria levels were 36.08 times (95% CI: 7.28 to 64.88) higher in patients with CD4+ lymphocyte counts below 200/mL (p = 0.016). No significant differences were found in HIV loads and CD8+ lymphocyte counts. Conclusion: Chunap shows potential for early detection of Chagas reactivation. With appropriate adaptation, this diagnostic test can be used to monitor Chagas disease status in T. cruzi/HIV co-infected patients. © 2016 Castro-Sesquen et al.",,"National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS, (R21AR061075); National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS",Use of a Chagas Urine Nanoparticle Test (Chunap) to Correlate with Parasitemia Levels in T. cruzi/HIV Co-infected Patients,NO

As an antigen, it can be detected in the blood of an infected person, from or before the onset of the symptoms. This makes it a biomarker for early detection of these diseases recently. The K-NN is a non-parametric method that shows strong capability in pattern recognition, classification and machine learning. Here, the K-NN classifier is used to distinguish SERS spectra of the salivary adulterated NS1 samples from the controlled samples. Since the features of SERS spectra is of high dimension, the K-NN classifier is preceded by the PCA to remove the redundant features and noise with Scree Test criterion. The performance of the PCA K-NN classifier is then investigated, using K-values between 1 and 19.

In fuzzy inference system, a set of rules are used for representing the knowledge or data of a particular problem. Dengue fever, caused by the dengue virus, a mosquito-borne human viral pathogen is an infectious tropical disease. In a small proportion of cases Dengue disease is considered as one of the life threatening disease and delay of the diagnosis may lead to increase the risk level of the disease. Therefore, it is very important to detect the dengue disease at early stage. Thus this work was aimed to design an expert system for the early diagnosis of dengue disease using Fuzzy Inference System (FIS), a powerful tool for dealing with imprecision and uncertainty. The designed FIS can be used for early diagnosis of dengue disease of a patient by using his/her physical symptoms and medical test reports as input variables and converting these input variables into fuzzy membership functions. © 2016 IEEE.",Dengue fever; Fuzzy Inference System; Fuzzy logic; Membership Function,,Early diagnosis of dengue disease using fuzzy inference system,NO

In the microscopic image of thin blood smear, blood components such as erythrocytes, platelets etc are available which is used for diagnostic approach to blood disorder. In the microscopic image, both the isolated and compound erythrocytes are also present. Compound erythrocyte is formed due to overlapping of two or more erythrocytes. In malaria diagnosis, parasitaemia estimation is done which define the ratio of infected erythrocytes related to total number of erythrocytes in microscopic image. For proper quantification of erythrocyte, erythrocytes need to be separated as isolated cell and compound cell. As isolated cells directly count in the counting system and compound cells are further analysed to determine number of erythrocytes. The proposed method to separate the isolated and compound cell provides an average accuracy of ~0.942.

The purpose of this study is to determine the activity of Th2 immune response by measuring total serum IgE level during symptomatic and asymptomatic HIV infection with and without helminths co-infection and to define the role of deworming and/or ART on kinetics of serum IgE. Methods: This prospective comparative study was conducted among symptomatic HIV-1 infected adults, treatment naïve asymptomatic HIV positive individuals and HIV negative apparently healthy controls with and without helminths co-infection. Detection and quantification of helminths and determination of serum IgE level, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell count were done at baseline and 12 weeks after ART and/or deworming. Results: HIV patients co-infected with helminths showed a high level of serum IgE compared to HIV patients without helminths co-infection (1,688 [IQR 721-2,473] versus 1,221 [IQR 618-2,289] IU/ml; P = 0.022). This difference was also markedly observed between symptomatic HIV infected patients after with and without helminths infection (1,690 [IQR 1,116-2,491] versus 1,252 [703-2,251] IU/ml; P = 0.047). A significant decline in serum IgE level was observed 12 weeks after deworming and ART of symptomatic HIV infected patients with (1,487 versus 992, P = 0.002) and without (1,233 versus 976 IU/ml, P = 0.093) helminths co-infection.

OBJECTIVE To determine if longer-storage RBC units are not inferior to shorter-storage RBC units for tissue oxygenation as measured by reduction in blood lactate levels and improvement in cerebral tissue oxygen saturation among children with severe anemia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized noninferiority trial of 290 children (aged 6-60 months), most with malaria or sickle cell disease, presenting February 2013 through May 2015 to a university-Affiliated national referral hospital in Kampala, Uganda, with a hemoglobin level of 5 g/dL or lower and a lactate level of 5 mmol/L or higher. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to receive RBC units stored 25 to 35 days (longer-storage group; n = 145) vs 1 to 10 days (shorter-storage group; n = 145). All units were leukoreduced prior to storage. All patients received 10 mL/kg of RBCs during hours 0 through 2 and, if indicated per protocol, an additional 10 mL/kg during hours 4 through 6. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas the proportion of patients with a lactate level of 3 mmol/L or lower at 8 hours using a margin of noninferiority equal to an absolute difference of 25%. Secondary measures included noninvasive cerebral tissue oxygen saturation during the first transfusion, clinical and laboratory changes up to 24 hours, and survival and health at 30 days after transfusion. Adverse eventswere monitored up to 24 hours. RESULTS In the total population of 290 children, the mean (SD) presenting hemoglobin level was 3.7 g/dL (1.3) and mean lactate level was 9.3 mmol/L (3.4). Median (interquartile range) RBC unit storage was 8 days (7-9) for shorter storage vs 32 days (30-34) for longer storage without overlap. The proportion achieving the primary end point was 0.61 (95%CI, 0.52 to 0.69) in the longer-storage group vs 0.58 (95%CI, 0.49 to 0.66) in the shorter-storage group (between-group difference, 0.03 [95%CI, ?0.07 to ∞], P < .001), meeting the prespecified margin of noninferiority. Mean lactate levels were not statistically different between the 2 groups at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 24 hours. Kaplan-Meier analysis and global nonlinear regression revealed no statistical difference in lactate reduction between the 2 groups. Clinical assessment, cerebral oxygen saturation, electrolyte abnormalities, adverse events, survival, and 30-day recovery were also not significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among children with lactic acidosis due to severe anemia, transfusion of longer-storage compared with shorter-storage RBC units did not result in inferior reduction of elevated blood lactate levels. These findings have relevance regarding the efficacy of stored RBC transfusion for patients with critical tissue hypoxia and lactic acidosis due to anemia.

Two drugs are currently used for the etiological treatment of the disease: Nifurtimox (Lampit) and Benznidazole. This study presents a quasi-experimental trial (non-control group) of sixty-two patients who were treated for Chagas disease with Nifurtimox (Lampit), and were then followed for 30 months post-treatment. The safety of Nifurtimox (Lampit) for Chagas disease in this group of children primarily between 4 and 19 years old was also evaluated. Materials and methods The 62 patients included in the study were selected when resulted seropositive for two out of three fundamentally different serological tests. All children were treated during two months according to protocols established by WHO. Monitoring was performed every twenty days to evaluate treatment safety. In 43 patients, two different serological tests: ELISA and IFAT; and two parasitological tests: blood culture, and real time PCR, (qPCR) were performed to assess therapeutic response, defined as post-treatment serological negativization. Principal findings All patients completed the treatment successfully, and six patients abandoned the post-treatment follow-up. Adverse effects occurred in 74% of patients, but only 4.8% of cases required temporary suspension to achieve 100% adherence to the 60-day treatment, and all symptoms reverted after treatment completion. Both parasite load (measured through qPCR) and antibodies (ELISA absorbance) evidenced a significant median reduction 6 months after treatment from 6.2 to 0.2 parasite equivalents/mL, and from 0.6 to 0.2 absorbance units respectively (p<0.001). Serological negativization by ELISA was evident since 6 months post-treatment, whereas by IFAT only after 18 months. Serological negativization by the two tests (ELISA and IFAT) was 41.9% (95%CI: 26.5–57.3) after 30 months post-treatment. qPCR was positive in 88.3% of patients pre-treatment and only in 12.1% of patients after 30 months. Survival analysis indicated that only 26.3% (95%CI: 15.5–44.8) persisted with negative qPCR during the whole follow-up period. Conclusions Nifurtimox was very well tolerated and successfully reduced parasite load and antibody titers. Re-infection, lysed parasites or a lack of anti-parasitic activity could explain these persistently positive qPCR cases. © 2015 Bianchi et al.",,,Follow-up of an Asymptomatic Chagas Disease Population of Children after Treatment with Nifurtimox (Lampit) in a Sylvatic Endemic Transmission Area of Colombia,NO

Stored blood samples and data from two geographically separate studies were used: one a recruitment phase of a clinical trial of anti-filarial agent dosing regimens, and the other a whole population annual HIV sero-survey. In study one, 1,851 consecutive adult volunteers were screened for HIV and LF infection. CFA prevalence was 25.4% (43/169) in HIV-positive and 23.6% (351/ 1487) in HIV-negative participants (p=0.57). Geometric mean CFA concentrations were 859 and 1660 antigen units per ml of blood (Ag/ml) respectively, geometric mean ratio (GMR) 0.85, 95%CI 0.49-1.50. In 7,863 adults in study two, CFA prevalence was 20.9% (86/411) in HIV-positive and 24.0% (1789/7452) in HIV–negative participants (p=0.15). Geometric mean CFA concentrations were 630 and 839 Ag/ml respectively (GMR 0.75, 95%CI 0.60-0.94). In the HIV-positive group, antiretroviral therapy (ART) use was associated with a lower CFA prevalence, 12.7%(18/142) vs. 25.3%(67/265), (OR 0.43, 95%CI 0.24-0.76).

The disease progresses from an early (hemo-lymphatic) stage to the late (meningoencephalitic) stage characterized by presence of parasites in the central nervous system. We hypothesized that disease progression and severity of the neurological response is modulated by cytokines. Methods A total of 55 sleeping sickness cases and 41 healthy controls were recruited passively at Lwala hospital, in Northern Uganda. A panel of six cytokines (IFN-γ, IL1-β, TNF-α, IL-6, TGF-β and IL-10) were assayed from paired plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Cytokine concentrations were analyzed in relation to disease progression, clinical presentation and severity of neurological responses. Results Median plasma levels (pg/ml) of IFN-γ (46.3), IL-6 (61.7), TGF-β (8755) and IL-10 (256.6) were significantly higher in cases compared to controls (p< 0.0001). When early stage and late stage CSF cytokines were compared, IL-10 and IL-6 were up regulated in late stage patients and were associated with a reduction in tremors and cranioneuropathy. IL-10 had a higher staging accuracy with a sensitivity of 85.7%(95% CI, 63.7%-97%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 39.8%-100%) while for IL-6, a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 47.8%-100%) gave a sensitivity of 83.3% (95% CI, 62.2%-95.3%). Conclusion Our study demonstrates the role of host inflammatory cytokines in modulating the progression and severity of neurological responses in sleeping sickness.

Objectives: To determine the frequency of overt DIC, according to ISTH criteria, in children with fatal and non-fatal CM. Methods/patients: Malawian children were recruited into a prospective cohort study in the following diagnostic groups: retinopathy-positive CM (n = 140), retinopathy-negative CM (n = 36), non-malarial coma (n = 14), uncomplicated malaria (UM), (n = 91), mild non-malarial febrile illness (n = 85), and healthy controls (n = 36). Assays in the ISTH DIC criteria were performed, and three fibrin-related markers, i.e. protein C, antithrombin, and soluble thrombomodulin, were measured. Results and conclusions: Data enabling assignment of the presence or absence of 'overt DIC' were available for 98 of 140 children with retinopathy-positive CM. Overt DIC was present in 19 (19%), and was associated with a fatal outcome (odds ratio [OR] 3.068; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.085-8.609; P = 0.035]. The levels of the three fibrin-related markers and soluble thrombomodulin were higher in CM patients than in UM patients (all P < 0.001). The mean fibrin degradation product level was higher in fatal CM patients (71.3 μg mL-1 [95% CI 49.0-93.6]) than in non-fatal CM patients (48.0 μg mL-1 [95% CI 37.7-58.2]; P = 0.032), but, in multivariate logistic regression, thrombomodulin was the only coagulation-related marker that was independently associated with a fatal outcome (OR 1.084 for each ng mL-1 increase [95% CI 1.017-1.156]; P = 0.014). Despite these laboratory derangements, no child in the study had clinically evident bleeding or thrombosis. An overt DIC score and high thrombomodulin levels are associated with a fatal outcome in CM, but infrequently indicate a consumptive coagulopathy. © 2015 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.","Blood coagulation; Disseminated intravascular coagulation; Endothelial cell protein C receptor; Fibrin; Malaria, cerebral","National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, (R01AI034969); Wellcome Trust, WT, (092668, 084679)",Laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation is associated with a fatal outcome in children with cerebral malaria despite an absence of clinically evident thrombosis or bleeding,NO

Objective: We aimed to evaluate the determinants of LAV in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Methods: Ninety patients with DCM and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction ≤ 0.50 were included. LAV was measured with real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (eco3D). The variables evaluated were heart rate, systolic blood pressure, LV end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume and ejection fraction (eco3D), mitral inflow E wave, tissue Doppler e´ wave, E/e´ ratio, intraventricular dyssynchrony, 3D dyssynchrony index and mitral regurgitation vena contracta. Pearson´s coefficient was used to identify the correlation of the LAV with the assessed variables. A multiple linear regression model was developed that included LAV as the dependent variable and the variables correlated with it as the predictive variables. Results: Mean age was 52 ± 11 years-old, LV ejection fraction: 31.5 ± 8.0% (16-50%) and LAV: 39.2±15.7 ml/m². The variables that correlated with the LAV were LV end-diastolic volume (r = 0.38; p < 0.01), LV end-systolic volume (r = 0.43; p < 0.001), LV ejection fraction (r = -0.36; p < 0.01), E wave (r = 0.50; p < 0.01), E/e´ ratio (r = 0.51; p < 0.01) and mitral regurgitation (r = 0.53; p < 0.01). A multivariate analysis identified the E/e´ ratio (p = 0.02) and mitral regurgitation (p = 0.02) as the only independent variables associated with LAV increase. Conclusion: The LAV is independently determined by LV filling pressures (E/e´ ratio) and mitral regurgitation in DCM. © 2015, Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia.

Currently affects 250-300 million people in tropic areas. Schistosoma pathogenic impact is hepatic periportal fibrosis; the parasite-induced inflammatory cellular activation promotes oxidative stress, resulting in lipid peroxidation (LPO), with subsequent increase in inflammatory mediators as malondialdehyde (MDA). This study was set up to reveal possible contribution of lipid peroxidation byproducts MDA in hepatic pathophysiology. Results displayed that MDA don't tend to change in relation with either age, nor hepatic transaminases AST & ALT, while exhibited a significant increase in MDA levels in human schistosomiasis versus control group P<0.0001 (Mn. ± St.dev. 7.77 ± 3.59, 1.21 ± 0.28 nmol/ml) respectively. Moreover; MDA plasma levels in Schistosoma infected group correlated significantly with two hepatic fibrosis parameters; (a) ultrasonography graded periportal fibrosis P< 0.0001. Levels of MDA in hepatic fibrosis grades 0, I, II, III in Schistosoma infected group were (Mn. ± St.dev. 2.8 ± 0.64, 4.3 ± 1.2, 9.3 ± 1.6 and 10.8 ± 1.3 nmol/ml) respectively, (b) serum Hyaluronic acid (HA) P<0.0001 (spearman r = 0.77) as a reliable hepatic fibrosis marker.

Existing drug treatments have limited efficacy in malaria elimination, and the complex pathogenesis of the disease is not fully understood. Detecting novel malaria-associated genes not only contributes in revealing the disease pathogenesis, but also facilitates discovering new targets for anti-malaria drugs. Methods: In this study, we developed a network-based approach to predict malaria-associated genes. We constructed a cross-species network to integrate human-human, parasite-parasite and human-parasite protein interactions. Then we extended the random walk algorithm on this network, and used known malaria genes as the seeds to find novel candidate genes for malaria. Results: We validated our algorithms using 77 known malaria genes: 14 human genes and 63 parasite genes were ranked averagely within top 2% and top 4%, respectively among human and parasite genomes. We also evaluated our method for predicting novel malaria genes using a set of 27 genes with literature supporting evidence. Our approach ranked 12 genes within top 1% and 24 genes within top 5%. In addition, we demonstrated that top-ranked candied genes were enriched for drug targets, and identified commonalities underlying top-ranked malaria genes through pathway analysis. In summary, the candidate malaria-associated genes predicted by our data-driven approach have the potential to guide genetics-based anti-malaria drug discovery. © 2015 Chen and Xu; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Disease gene prediction; Drug discovery; Malaria; Network analysis,"CoGE, (R25 CA094186-06); National Cancer Institute, NCI, (R25CA094186); National Cancer Institute, NCI",Network-based gene prediction for Plasmodium falciparum malaria towards genetics-based drug discovery,NO

There are hypotheses and study reports on the possible association between these two infections, hence the prevalence and outcome of their co-infection in an endemic population will be important in defining healthcare strategies. A cross sectional study was carried out at the Holy Family Hospital in Techiman, Ghana, between November 2011 and January 2012, to determine the prevalence of malaria among HIV sero-positive patients and its impact on hemoglobin levels. Method: A total of 400 HIV sero-positive participants (292 females and 108 males) aged between 1 and 73 years were randomly sampled for the study. A questionnaire was administered and 2 ml of venous blood samples were drawn for malaria parasites detection, CD4 count and haemoglobin level estimations. Results: Malaria parasites were detected in 47 (11.75%) of the participants. There was no statistically significant difference between the malaria prevalence rate of females (12.1%) and males (10.2%) P = 0.6047. An overall anaemia prevalence of 67% was observed. Among participants with malaria the anaemia prevalence was 93.6%. The CD4 cell count of all the participants ranged between 3 and 1604 cells/μl with a mean of 386.2 (±274.3) cells/μl. Participants with malaria had CD4 cell count ranged 3 and 512 Cells/μl with the mean being 186.33 (±133.49) Cells/μl. Out of 377 participants (all above 15 years) interviewed on knowledge of malaria transmission and prevention, 87.0% had knowledge on transmission but only 8.5% use in bed nets.

A dataset 545 agrochemicals selected from ChEMBL database was used to generate both models and the prediction performance was tested using a small set of 44 alkaloids with the antitrypanosomal activity. From 469 Apocynaceae alkaloids, the SVM model selected, as actives, 5 similar alkaloids, from 2 species of the Aspidosperma genus (excelsum, marcgravianum), and the DT model selected 3 alkaloids from 3 species (gilbertii, nigracans, and subincanum) of the same genera from the SISTEMATX database. The values of Moriguchi octanol-water partition coefficient for these structures are between 2.3 to 5.3, and 5 alkaloids, passed the Lipinski alert index filter and Drug Like Score consensus (> 0.7), which indicate that these compounds are good candidates to become a drug.

Objective: The objective of the study was to prospectively assess the association of vitamin D status with mortality, morbidity, and growth during the first 2 y of life. Methods: A prospective cohort of 253 HIV-infected and 948 HIV-exposed Tanzanian infants enrolled in a randomized trial of multivitamins (not including vitamin D) was studied. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations were measured at 5-7 wk of age and infants were followed at monthly clinic visits until 24 mo. Physicians performed a clinical exam every 3 mo or when an illness was noted. Results: Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were (means ± SDs) 18.6 ± 10.3 ng/mL and 18.1 ± 9.2 ng/mL for HIV-infected and HIV-exposed infants, respectively. Unexpectedly, serum 25(OH)D concentrations ≥30 ng/mL were significantly associated with highermortality as compared to the 20-29.9 ng/mL reference for HIV-infected (HR: 2.47; 95% CI: 1.13, 5.44; P=0.02) and HIV-exposed (HR: 4.00; 95%CI: 1.67, 9.58; P < 0.01) infants aftermultivariate adjustment.We found no statistically significant association between 25(OH)D concentrations <10 ng/mL and mortality for HIV-infected (HR: 1.43; 95% CI: 0.74, 2.78; P = 0.29) and HIV-exposed (HR: 1.56; 95% CI: 0.60, 4.03; P = 0.36) infants.

Due to its reliance on trained microscopists, field microscopy often suffers from poor sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. The goal of this work, called the Autoscope, is a low-cost automated digital microscope coupled with a set of computer vision and classification algorithms, which can accurately diagnose of a variety of infectious diseases, targeting use-cases in the developing world. Our initial target is malaria, because of the high difficulty of the task and because manual microscopy is currently a central but highly imperfect tool for malaria work in the field. In addition to diagnosis, the algorithm performs species identification and quantitation of parasite load, parameters which are critical in many field applications but which are not effectively determined by rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). We have built a hardware prototype which can scan approximately 0.1 μL of blood volume in a standard Giemsa-stained thick smear blood slide in approximately 20 minutes. We have also developed a comprehensive machine learning framework, leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques including support vector machines (SVMs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Accurate diagnosis of pneumonia relies on expensive human expertise and requires the evaluation of multiple clinical characteristics, measured using advanced diagnostic tools. The shortage of clinical experts and appropriate diagnostic tools in many low and middle income countries impedes timely and accurate diagnosis. We demonstrate that the diagnostic process can be automated using machine learning techniques, processing several clinical measurements that could be obtained with affordable and easy-to-operate point-of-care tools. We evaluated our findings on a dataset of 1093 children, comprising 777 diagnosed with pneumonia and 316 healthy controls, on the basis of 47 clinical characteristics. Seven feature selection techniques were used to identify robust, parsimonious subsets of clinical characteristics, which could be measured reliably and affordably. Standard machine learning techniques, such as support vector machines and random forests, were used to develop a predictive algorithm based on the four jointly most predictive characteristics (temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate and oxygen saturation); this approach led to 96.6% sensitivity, 96.4% specificity, and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 97.8%. The proposed approach can be easily embedded in a mobile phone application, allowing for point-of-care assessment and identification of children in need of clinical attention by basically trained healthcare workers in resource-constrained settings. © 2015 IEEE.",Childhood pneumonia; diagnostics; machine learning; Random forests,,Smart diagnostic algorithms for automated detection of childhood pneumonia in resource-constrained settings,YES
